      <title>Foreclosure Complementarities</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent merger cases across complementary markets, antitrust authorities have expressed foreclosure concerns. In particular, the presence of scale economies in one market might propagate to the complementary market, ultimately leading to the monopolization of both. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between two foreclosure practices: exclusionary bundling and predatory pricing in the setting of complementary markets with economies of scale. We show that the two practices are complementary when markets display economies of scale, exclusionary bundling is more likely and, when bundling is allowed, predatory pricing is more likely. We show that this outcome is due to exit-inducing behavior of dominant firms: shutting down predatory incentives restores competition in both markets. We investigate different policies: banning mergers between market leaders, allowing product bundling only when more than one firm is integrated and able to offer the bundle, and lastly knowledge sharing across firms in order to limit the economies of scale. All policies are effective, each for a different reason.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Approximation Methods for Large Dynamic Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://matteocourthoud.github.io/project/approximations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic stochastic games notoriously suffer from a curse of dimensionality that makes computing the Markov Perfect Equilibrium of large games infeasible. This article compares the existing approximation methods and alternative equilibrium concepts that have been proposed in the literature to overcome this problem. No method clearly dominates the others but some are dominated in all dimensions. In general, alternative equilibrium concepts outperform sampling-based approximation methods. I propose a new game structure, games with random order, in which players move sequentially and the order of play is unknown. The Markov Perfect equilibrium of this game consistently outperforms all existing approximation methods in terms of approximation accuracy while still being extremely efficient in terms of computational time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ownership and Product Similarity</title>
      <link>https://matteocourthoud.github.io/project/ownership/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I generate a time-varying measure of S&amp;amp;P500 firm similarity using a zero-shot clustering model. The model takes as input BERT embeddings of product descriptions and is trained on market definitions from the EU commission. The objective is to estimate the causal effect of common ownership on product similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
