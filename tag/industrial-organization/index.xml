      <title>Algorithmic Collusion on Online Marketplaces</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The use of algorithms to set prices is particularly popular in online marketplaces, where sellers need to take quick decisions in complex dynamic environments. In this article, I investigate the role of online marketplaces in facilitating or preventing collusion among sellers that use pricing algorithms. In particular, I investigate a platform that has the ability to give prominence to certain products and automates this decision through a reinforcement learning algorithm, that maximizes the platform&amp;rsquo;s profits. Depending on whether the business model of the platform is more aligned with consumer welfare or with sellers&#39; profits (e.g., if it collects quantity or profit fees), the platform either prevents or facilitates collusion among algorithmic sellers. If the platform is also active as a seller, the so-called dual role, it is able to both induce sellers to set high prices and appropriate most of the profits. Importantly, self-preferencing only happens during the learning phase and not in equilibrium. I investigate a potential solution: separating the sales and marketplace divisions. The policy is effective but does not fully restore the competitive outcome when the fee is distortive, as in the case of a revenue fee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Foreclosure Complementarities</title>
      <link>https://matteocourthoud.github.io/project/foreclosure/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent merger cases across complementary markets, antitrust authorities have expressed foreclosure concerns. In particular, the presence of scale economies in one market might propagate to the complementary market, ultimately leading to the monopolization of both. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between two foreclosure practices: exclusionary bundling and predatory pricing in the setting of complementary markets with economies of scale. We show that the two practices are complementary when markets display economies of scale, exclusionary bundling is more likely and, when bundling is allowed, predatory pricing is more likely. We show that this outcome is due to exit-inducing behavior of dominant firms: shutting down predatory incentives restores competition in both markets. We investigate different policies: banning mergers between market leaders, allowing product bundling only when more than one firm is integrated and able to offer the bundle, and lastly knowledge sharing across firms in order to limit the economies of scale. All policies are effective, each for a different reason.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://matteocourthoud.github.io/project/alg_detection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning algorithms are gradually replacing humans in many decision-making processes, such as pricing in high-frequency markets. Recent studies on algorithmic pricing have shown that algorithms can learn sophisticated grim-trigger strategies with the intent of keeping supra-competitive prices. This paper focuses on algorithmic collusion detection. One frequent suggestion is to look at the inputs of the strategies, for example at whether the algorithms condition their prices on previous competitors&#39; prices. The first part of the paper shows that this approach might not be sufficient to detect collusion since the algorithms can learn reward-punishment schemes that are fully independent of the rival’s actions. The mechanism that ensures the stability of supra-competitive prices is self-punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the paper explores a novel test for algorithmic collusion detection. The test builds on the intuition that as algorithms are able to learn to collude, they might be able to learn to exploit collusive strategies. In fact, since they are not designed to learn sub-game perfect equilibrium strategies, there is the possibility that their strategies could be exploited. When one algorithm is unilaterally retrained, keeping the collusive strategies of its competitor fixed, it learns more profitable strategies. Usually, these strategies are more competitive, but not always. Since this change in strategies happens only when algorithms are colluding, retraining can be used as a test to detect algorithmic collusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the test implementable, the last part of the paper studies whether one could get the same insights on collusive behavior using only observational data, from a single algorithm. The result is a unilateral empirical test for algorithmic collusion that does not require any assumptions neither on the algorithms themselves nor on the underlying environment. The key insight is that algorithms, during their learning phase, produce natural experiments that allow an observer to estimate their behavior in counterfactual scenarios. The simulations show that, at least in a controlled experimental setting, the test is extremely successful in detecting algorithmic collusion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Approximation Methods for Large Dynamic Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://matteocourthoud.github.io/project/approximations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic stochastic games notoriously suffer from a curse of dimensionality that makes computing the Markov Perfect Equilibrium of large games infeasible. This article compares the existing approximation methods and alternative equilibrium concepts that have been proposed in the literature to overcome this problem. No method clearly dominates the others but some are dominated in all dimensions. In general, alternative equilibrium concepts outperform sampling-based approximation methods. I propose a new game structure, games with random order, in which players move sequentially and the order of play is unknown. The Markov Perfect equilibrium of this game consistently outperforms all existing approximation methods in terms of approximation accuracy while still being extremely efficient in terms of computational time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ownership and Product Similarity</title>
      <link>https://matteocourthoud.github.io/project/ownership/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I generate a time-varying measure of S&amp;amp;P500 firm similarity using a zero-shot clustering model. The model takes as input BERT embeddings of product descriptions and is trained on market definitions from the EU commission. The objective is to estimate the causal effect of common ownership on product similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
