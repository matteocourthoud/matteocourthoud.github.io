However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to start with an introduction to the different types of data structures available in Python, their characteristics, their differences and their comparative advantages.\nThe most important data structures in Python are:\n lists tuples sets dictionaries numpy arrays pandas DataFrames pyspark DataFrames  Lists A list is a mutable array data structure in Python with the following characteristics:\n can hold any type of data can hold different types of data at the same time can be modified  We can generate lists using square brackets.\nl = [12, \u0026quot;world\u0026quot;, [3,4,5]] print(l)  [12, 'world', [3, 4, 5]]  Since lists are ordered, we can access their element by calling the position of the element in the list.\nl[0]  12  Since lists are mutable, we can modify their elements.\nl[0] = 'hello' print(l)  ['hello', 'world', [3, 4, 5]]  We can add elements to a list using .append().\nl.append(23) l  ['hello', 'world', [3, 4, 5], 23]  We can remove elements by calling del on it.\ndel l[0] print(l)  ['world', [3, 4, 5], 23]  We can combine two lists using +. Note that this operation does not modify the list but generates a new one.\nl + [23]  ['world', [3, 4, 5], 23, 23]  We can also generate lists using comprehensions.\nl = [n for n in range(3)] print(l)  [0, 1, 2]  Comprehensions are a powerful tool!\nl = [n+10 for n in range(10) if (n%2==0) and (n\u0026gt;4)] print(l)  [16, 18]  Tuples A tuple is an immutable array data structure in Python with the following characteristics:\n can hold any type of data can hold different types of data at the same time can not be modified  We can generate tuples using curve brackets.\n# A list of different data types t = (12, \u0026quot;world\u0026quot;, [3,4,5]) print(t)  (12, 'world', [3, 4, 5])  Since tuples are ordered, we can access their element by calling the position of the element in the list.\nt[0]  12  Since tuples are unmutable, we cannot modify their elements.\n# Try to modify element try: t[0] = 'hello' except Exception as e: print(e)  'tuple' object does not support item assignment  # Try to add element try: t.append('hello') except Exception as e: print(e)  'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'  # Try to remove element try: del t[0] except Exception as e: print(e)  'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion  We can combine two tuples using +. Note that this operation does not modify the tuple but generates a new one. Also note that to generate a 1-element tuple we need to insert a comma.\nt + (23,)  (12, 'world', [3, 4, 5], 23)  We can generate tuples using comprehensions, but we need to specify it\u0026rsquo;s a tuple.\nt = tuple(n for n in range(3)) print(t)  (0, 1, 2)  Sets A set is a mutable array data structure in Python with the following characteristics:\n can only hold hashable types can hold different types of data at the same time cannot be modified cannot contain duplicates  We can generate using curly brackets.\ns = {12, \u0026quot;world\u0026quot;, (3,4,5)} print(s)  {(3, 4, 5), 12, 'world'}  Since sets are unordered and unindexed, we cannot access single elements by calling their position.\n# Try to access element by position try: s[0] except Exception as e: print(e)  'set' object is not subscriptable  Since sets are unordered, we cannot modify their elements by specifying the position.\n# Try to modify element try: s[0] = 'hello' except Exception as e: print(e)  'set' object does not support item assignment  However, since sets are mutable, we can add elements using .add().\ns.add('hello') print(s)  {'hello', (3, 4, 5), 12, 'world'}  However, we cannot add duplicates.\ns.add('hello') print(s)  {'hello', (3, 4, 5), 12, 'world'}  We can delete elements of a set using .remove().\ns.remove('hello') print(s)  {(3, 4, 5), 12, 'world'}  We can also generate sets using comprehensions.\ns = {n for n in range(3)} print(s)  {0, 1, 2}  Dictionaries A dictionary is a mutable array data structure in Python with the following characteristics:\n can hold any type can hold different types at the same time can be modified items are named  We can generate dictionaries using curly brackets. Since elements are indexed by keys, we have to provide one for each element.\nDictionary keys can be of any hashable type. A hashable object has a hash value that never changes during its lifetime, and it can be compared to other objects. Hashable objects that compare as equal must have the same hash value.\nImmutable types like strings and numbers are hashable and work well as dictionary keys. You can also use tuple objects as dictionary keys as long as they contain only hashable types themselves.\nd = {\u0026quot;first\u0026quot;: 12, 2: \u0026quot;world\u0026quot;, (3,): [3,4,5]} print(d)  {'first': 12, 2: 'world', (3,): [3, 4, 5]}  Since dictionaries are indexed but not ordered, we can only access elements by the corresponding key. If the corresponding key does not exist, we do not access any element.\ntry: d[0] except Exception as e: print(e)  0  We can access all values of the dictionary using .values().\nd.values()  dict_values([12, 'world', [3, 4, 5]])  We can access all keys of the dictionary using .keys().\nd.keys()  dict_keys(['first', 2, (3,)])  We can access both values and keys using .items().\nd.items()  dict_items([('first', 12), (2, 'world'), ((3,), [3, 4, 5])])  This gives us a list of tuples which we can iterate on.\n[f\u0026quot;{key}: {value}\u0026quot; for key, value in d.items()]  ['first: 12', '2: world', '(3,): [3, 4, 5]']  Since dictionaries are mutable, we can modify their elements.\nd[\u0026quot;first\u0026quot;] = 'hello' print(d)  {'first': 'hello', 2: 'world', (3,): [3, 4, 5]}  If we try to modify an element that does not exist, the element is added to the dictionary.\nd[0] = 'hello' print(d)  {'first': 'hello', 2: 'world', (3,): [3, 4, 5], 0: 'hello'}  We can remove elements using del.\ndel d[0] print(d)  {'first': 'hello', 2: 'world', (3,): [3, 4, 5]}  We can cannot combine two dictionaries using +. We can only add one element at the time.\ntry: d + {\u0026quot;fourth\u0026quot;: (1,2)} except Exception as e: print(e)  unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'dict' and 'dict'  We can also generate dictionaries using comprehensions.\nd = {f\u0026quot;k{n}\u0026quot;: n+1 for n in range(3)} print(d)  {'k0': 1, 'k1': 2, 'k2': 3}  Numpy Arrays A numpy array is a mutable array data structure in Python with the following characteristics:\n can hold any type of data can only hold one type at the same time can be modified can be multi-dimensional support matrix operations  We can generate numpy arrays are generated the np.array() function on a list.\na = np.array([1,2,3]) print(a)  [1 2 3]  We can make 2-dimensional arrays (a matrix) as lists of lists.\nm = np.array([[1,2,3] , [4,5,6]]) print(m)  [[1 2 3] [4 5 6]]  Since numpy arrays are mutable, we can modify elements by calling the index of the numpy array.\nm[0,0] = 89 print(m)  [[89 2 3] [ 4 5 6]]  We can check the shape of a numpy array using .shape\nm.shape  (2, 3)  We can expand dimensions of a numpy array using .expand_dims().\na = np.expand_dims(a,1) print(a)  [[1] [2] [3]]  We can transpose matrices using .T.\na = a.T print(a)  [[1 2 3]]  We add elements to a numpy array using np.concatenate(). All elements must have the same number of dimensions and must have the same number of elements along the concatenation axis.\nm = np.concatenate((m, a), axis=0) print(m)  [[89 2 3] [ 4 5 6] [ 1 2 3]]  We cannot remove elements of numpy arrays.\ntry: del a[0] except Exception as e: print(e)  cannot delete array elements  We can do matrix operations between numpy arrays. For example, we can do multiplication with @.\na @ m  array([[100, 18, 24]])  If we use * we get dot (or element-wise) multiplication instead.\na * m  array([[89, 4, 9], [ 4, 10, 18], [ 1, 4, 9]])  There is a wide array of functions available in numpy. For example np.invert() inverts a squared matrix.\nnp.invert(m)  array([[-90, -3, -4], [ -5, -6, -7], [ -2, -3, -4]])  Comparison Which data structure should you use and why?

A matrix $A$ can be multiplied by a scalar $c\\in \\mathbb{R}$ in which case we set $[cA]_{ij} = c[A] _{ij}$. An $n \\times m$ matrix $A$ can be multiplied with an $m \\times p$ matrix $B$. The product $AB$ is defined according to the rule $[AB] _ {ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^m [A] _{ik} [B] _{kj}$. An $n \\times n$ matrix is invertible if there exists a matrix $B$ such that $AB=I$. In this case, we use the notational convention of writing $B = A^{-1}$. Matrix transposition is defined by $[A'] _{ij} = [A] _{ji}$.  Trace and Determinant The trace of a square matrix $A$ with dimension $n \\times n$ is $\\text{tr}(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii}$.\nThe determinant of a square $n \\times n$ matrix A is defined according to one of the following three (equivalent) definitions.\n Recursively as $det(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} (-1)^{i+j} det([A]{-i,-j})$ where $[A]{-i,-j}$ is the matrix obtained by deleting the $i$th row and the $j$th column. $A \\mapsto det(A)$ under the unique alternating multilinear map on $n \\times n$ matrices such that $I \\mapsto 1$.  Linear Independence Vectors $x_1,\u0026hellip;,x_k$ are linearly independent if the only solution to the equation $b_1x_1 + \u0026hellip; + b_k x_k=0, \\ b_j \\in \\mathbb R$, is $b_1=b_2=\u0026hellip;=b_k=0$.\nUseful Identities  $(A+B)' =A'+B'$ $(AB)C = A(BC)$ $A(B+C) = AB+AC$ $(AB') = B\u0026rsquo;A'$ $(A^{-1})' = (A')^{-1}$ $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$ $\\text{tr}(cA) = c\\text{tr}(A)$ $\\text{tr}(A+B) = \\text{tr}(A) + \\text{tr}(B)$ $\\text{tr}(AB) =\\text{tr}(BA)$ $det(I)=1$ $det(cA) = c^ndet(A)$ if $A$ is $n \\times n$ and $c \\in \\mathbb R$ $det(A) = det(A')$ $det(AB) = det(A)det(B)$ $det(A^{-1}) = (det(A))^{-1}$ $A^{-1}$ exists iff $det(A) \\neq 0$ $rank(A) = rank(A') = rank(A\u0026rsquo;A) = rank(AA')$ $A^{-1}$ exists iff $rank(A)=n$ for $A$ $n \\times n$ $rank(AB) \\leq \\min \\lbrace rank(A), rank(B) \\rbrace$  Matrix Rank The rank of a matrix, $rank(A)$ is equal to the maximal number of linearly independent rows for $A$.\nLet $A$ be an $n \\times n$ matrix. The $n \\times 1$ vector $x \\neq 0$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is $Ax = \\lambda x$.\nDefinitions  A matrix $A$ is diagonal if $[A]_ {ij} \\neq 0$ only if $i=j$. An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ is orthogonal if $A\u0026rsquo;A = I$ A matrix $A$ is symmetric if $[A]_ {ij} = [A]_ {ji}$. An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ is idempotent if $A^2=A$. The matrix of zeros ($[A]_ {ij} =0$ for each $i,j$) is simply denoted 0. An $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ is nilpotent if $A^k=0$ for some integer $k\u0026gt;0$.  Spectral Decomposition Spectral Theorem Theorem: Let $A$ be an $n \\times n$ symmetric matrix. Then $A$ can be factored as $A = C \\Lambda C'$ where $C$ is orthogonal and $\\Lambda$ is diagonal.\nIf we postmultiply $A$ by $C$, we get\n $AC = C \\Lambda C\u0026rsquo;C$ and $AC = C \\Lambda$.   This is a matrix equation which can be split into columns. The $i$th column of the equation reads $A c_i = \\lambda_i c_i$ which corresponds to the definition of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So if the decomposition exists, then $C$ is the eigenvector matrix and $\\Lambda$ contains the eigenvalues.\n Rank and Trace Theorem: The rank of a symmetric matrix equals the number of non zero eigenvalues.\nProof: $rank(A) = rank(C\\Lambda C') = rank(\\Lambda) = | \\lbrace i: \\lambda_i \\neq 0 \\rbrace |$. $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nTheorem: The nonzero eigenvalues of $AA'$ and $A\u0026rsquo;A$ are identical.\nTheorem: The trace of a symmetric matrix equals the sum of its eignevalues.\nProof: $tr(A) = tr(C \\Lambda C') = tr((C \\Lambda)C') = tr(C\u0026rsquo;C \\Lambda) = tr(\\Lambda) = \\sum_ {i=1}^n \\lambda_i.$ $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nTheorem: The determinant of a symmetric matrix equals the product of its eignevalues.\nProof: $det(A) = det(C \\Lambda C') = det(C)det(\\Lambda)det(C') = det(C)det(C')det(\\Lambda) = det(CC') det(\\Lambda) = det(I)det(\\Lambda) = det(\\Lambda) = \\prod_ {i=1}^n \\lambda_i.$ $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nEigenvalues Theorem: For any symmetric matrix $A$, the eigenvalues of $A^2$ are the square of the eignevalues of $A$, and the eigenvectors are the same.\nProof: $A = C \\Lambda C' \\implies A^2 = C \\Lambda C' C \\Lambda C' = C \\Lambda I \\Lambda C' = C \\Lambda^2 C'$ $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nTheorem: For any symmetric matrix $A$, and any integer $k\u0026gt;0$, the eigenvalues of $A^k$ are the $k$th power of the eigenvalues of $A$, and the eigenvectors are the same.\nTheorem: Any square symmetric matrix $A$ with positive eigenvalues can be written as the product of a lower triangular matrix $L$ and its (upper triangular) transpose $L' = U$. That is $A = LU = LL'$\n Note that $$ A = LL' = LU = U\u0026rsquo;U = (L')^{-1}L^{-1} = U^{-1}(U')^{-1} $$ where $L^{-1}$ is lower triangular and $U^{ -1}$ is upper trianguar. You can check this for the $2 \\times 2$ case. Also note that the validity of the theorem can be extended to symmetric matrices with non- negative eigenvalues by a limiting argument. However, then the proof is not constructive anymore.\n Quadratic Forms and Definite Matrices Definition A quadratic form in the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ and $n \\times 1$ vector $x$ is defined by the scalar $x\u0026rsquo;Ax$.\n $A$ is negative definite (ND) if for each $x \\neq 0$, $x\u0026rsquo;Ax \u0026lt; 0$ $A$ is negative semidefinite (NSD) if for each $x \\neq 0$, $x\u0026rsquo;Ax \\leq 0$ $A$ is positive definite (PD) if for each $x \\neq 0$, $x\u0026rsquo;Ax \u0026gt; 0$ $A$ is positive semidefinite (PSD) if for each $x \\neq 0$, $x\u0026rsquo;Ax \\geq 0$  Equivalence Theorem: Let $A$ be a symmetric matrix. Then $A$ is PD(ND) $\\iff$ all of its eigenvalues are positive (negative).\nSome more results:\n If a symmetric matrix $A$ is PD (PSD, ND, NSD), then $\\text{det}(A) \u0026gt;(\\geq,\u0026lt;,\\leq) 0$. If symmetric matrix $A$ is PD (ND) then $A^{-1}$ is symmetric PD (ND). The identity matrix is PD (since all eigenvalues are equal to 1). Every symmetric idempotent matrix is PSD (since the eigenvalues are only 0 or 1).  Theorem: If $A$ is $n\\times k$ with $n\u0026gt;k$ and $rank(A)=k$, then $A\u0026rsquo;A$ is PD and $AA'$ is PSD.\nThe semidefinite partial order is defined by $A \\geq B$ iff $A-B$ is PSD.\nTheorem: Let $A$, $B$ be symmetric,square , PD, conformable. Then $A-B$ is PD iff $A^{-1}-B^{-1}$ is PD.\nMatrix Calculus Comformable Matrices We first define matrices blockwise when they are conformable. In particular, we assume that if $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4$ are matrices with appropriate dimensions then the matrix $$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} A_1 \u0026amp; A_1 \\newline A_3 \u0026amp; A_4 \\end{bmatrix} $$ is defined in the obvious way.\nMatrix Functions Let $F: \\mathbb R^m \\times \\mathbb R^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb R^p \\times \\mathbb R^q$ be a matrix valued function. More precisely, given a real $m \\times n$ matrix $X$, $F(X)$ returns the $p \\times q$ matrix\n$$ \\begin{bmatrix} f_ {11}(X) \u0026amp; \u0026hellip; \u0026amp; f_ {1q}(X) \\newline \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\newline f_ {p1}(X)\u0026amp; \u0026hellip; \u0026amp; f_ {pq}(X) \\end{bmatrix} $$\nMatrix Derivatives The derivative of $F$ with respect to the matrix $X$ is the $mp \\times nq$ matrix $$ \\frac{\\partial F(X)}{\\partial X} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F(X)}{\\partial x_ {11}} \u0026amp; \u0026hellip; \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial F(X)}{\\partial x_ {1n}} \\newline \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\newline \\frac{\\partial F(X)}{\\partial x_ {m1}} \u0026amp; \u0026hellip; \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial F(X)}{\\partial x_ {mn}} \\end{bmatrix} $$ where each $\\frac{\\partial F(X)}{\\partial x_ {ij}}$ is a $p\\times q$ matrix given by\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F(X)}{\\partial x_ {ij}} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_ {11}(X)}{\\partial x_ {ij}} \u0026amp; \u0026hellip; \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_ {1q}(X)}{\\partial x_ {ij}} \\newline \\vdots \u0026amp; \\ddots \u0026amp; \\vdots \\newline \\frac{\\partial f_ {p1}(X)}{\\partial x_ {ij}} \u0026amp; \u0026hellip; \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial f_ {pq}(X)}{\\partial x_ {ij}} \\end{bmatrix} $$ The most important case is when $F: \\mathbb R^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$ since this simplifies the derivation of the least squares estimator.

These variables and other data used in the paper are available for download on Daron Acemoglu’s webpage.\nThe original dataset in in Stata .dta format but has been converted to .csv.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s load the data and have a look at it.\n# Load Acemoglu Johnson Robinson Dataset df = pd.read_csv('data/AJR02.csv',index_col=0) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  GDP Exprop Mort Latitude Neo Africa Asia Namer Samer logMort Latitude2     1 8.39 6.50 78.20 0.3111 0 1 0 0 0 4.359270 0.096783   2 7.77 5.36 280.00 0.1367 0 1 0 0 0 5.634790 0.018687   3 9.13 6.39 68.90 0.3778 0 0 0 0 1 4.232656 0.142733   4 9.90 9.32 8.55 0.3000 1 0 0 0 0 2.145931 0.090000   5 9.29 7.50 85.00 0.2683 0 0 0 1 0 4.442651 0.071985     Let’s use a scatterplot to see whether any obvious relationship exists between GDP per capita and the protection against expropriation.\n# Plot relationship between GDP and expropriation rate fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1) ax.set_title('Figure 1: joint distribution of GDP and expropriation') df.plot(x='Exprop', y='GDP', kind='scatter', s=50, ax=ax);  The plot shows a fairly strong positive relationship between protection against expropriation and log GDP per capita.\nSpecifically, if higher protection against expropriation is a measure of institutional quality, then better institutions appear to be positively correlated with better economic outcomes (higher GDP per capita).\nGiven the plot, choosing a linear model to describe this relationship seems like a reasonable assumption.\nWe can write our model as\n$$ {GDP}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 {Exprop}_i + \\varepsilon_i $$\nwhere:\n $ \\beta_0 $ is the intercept of the linear trend line on the y-axis $ \\beta_1 $ is the slope of the linear trend line, representing the marginal effect of protection against risk on log GDP per capita $ \\varepsilon_i $ is a random error term (deviations of observations from the linear trend due to factors not included in the model)  The most common technique to estimate the parameters ($ \\beta $’s) of the linear model is Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).\nAs the name implies, an OLS model is solved by finding the parameters that minimize the sum of squared residuals, i.e.\n$$ \\underset{\\hat{\\beta}}{\\min} \\sum^N_{i=1}{\\hat{u}^2_i} $$\nwhere $ \\hat{u}_i $ is the difference between the observation and the predicted value of the dependent variable.\nTo estimate the constant term $ \\beta_0 $, we need to add a column of 1’s to our dataset (consider the equation if $ \\beta_0 $ was replaced with $ \\beta_0 x_i $ and $ x_i = 1 $)\nNow we can construct our model in statsmodels using the OLS function.\nWe will use pandas dataframes with statsmodels, however standard arrays can also be used as arguments\n# Regress GDP on Expropriation Rate reg1 = sm.OLS.from_formula('GDP ~ Exprop', df) type(reg1)  statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS  So far we have simply constructed our model.\nWe need to use .fit() to obtain parameter estimates $ \\hat{\\beta}_0 $ and $ \\hat{\\beta}_1 $\n# Fit regression results = reg1.fit() type(results)  statsmodels.regression.linear_model.RegressionResultsWrapper  We now have the fitted regression model stored in results.\nTo view the OLS regression results, we can call the .summary() method.\nNote that an observation was mistakenly dropped from the results in the original paper (see the note located in maketable2.do from Acemoglu’s webpage), and thus the coefficients differ slightly.\nresults.summary()  OLS Regression Results  Dep.

latitude is used to proxy this differences that affect both economic performance and institutions, eg. cultural, historical, etc.; controlled for with the use of continent dummies  Let’s estimate some of the extended models considered in the paper (Table 2) using data from maketable2.dta\n# Add constant term to dataset df['const'] = 1 # Create lists of variables to be used in each regression X1 = df[['const', 'Exprop']] X2 = df[['const', 'Exprop', 'Latitude', 'Latitude2']] X3 = df[['const', 'Exprop', 'Latitude', 'Latitude2', 'Asia', 'Africa', 'Namer', 'Samer']] # Estimate an OLS regression for each set of variables reg1 = sm.OLS(df['GDP'], X1, missing='drop').fit() reg2 = sm.OLS(df['GDP'], X2, missing='drop').fit() reg3 = sm.OLS(df['GDP'], X3, missing='drop').fit()  Now that we have fitted our model, we will use summary_col to display the results in a single table (model numbers correspond to those in the paper)\ninfo_dict={'No. observations' : lambda x: f\u0026quot;{int(x.nobs):d}\u0026quot;} results_table = summary_col(results=[reg1,reg2,reg3], float_format='%0.2f', stars = True, model_names=['Model 1','Model 2','Model 3'], info_dict=info_dict, regressor_order=['const','Exprop','Latitude','Latitude2']) results_table    Model 1 Model 2 Model 3   const 4.66*** 4.55*** 5.95***    (0.41) (0.45) (0.68)   Exprop 0.52*** 0.49*** 0.40***    (0.06) (0.07) (0.06)   Latitude  2.16 0.42     (1.68) (1.47)   Latitude2  -2.12 0.44     (2.86) (2.48)   Africa   -1.06**      (0.41)   Asia   -0.74*      (0.42)   Namer   -0.17      (0.40)   Samer   -0.12      (0.42)   No. observations 64 64 64   2.3 Endogeneity As [AJR01] discuss, the OLS models likely suffer from endogeneity issues, resulting in biased and inconsistent model estimates.\nNamely, there is likely a two-way relationship between institutions an economic outcomes:\n richer countries may be able to afford or prefer better institutions variables that affect income may also be correlated with institutional differences the construction of the index may be biased; analysts may be biased towards seeing countries with higher income having better institutions  To deal with endogeneity, we can use two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression, which is an extension of OLS regression.\nThis method requires replacing the endogenous variable $ {Exprop}_i $ with a variable that is:\n correlated with $ {Exprop}_i $ not correlated with the error term (ie. it should not directly affect the dependent variable, otherwise it would be correlated with $ u_i $ due to omitted variable bias)  We can write our model as\n$$ {GDP}_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 {Exprop}_i + \\varepsilon_i \\ {Exprop}_i = \\delta_0 + \\delta_1 {logMort}_i + v_i $$\nThe new set of regressors logMort is called an instrument, which aims to remove endogeneity in our proxy of institutional differences.\nThe main contribution of [AJR01] is the use of settler mortality rates to instrument for institutional differences.\nThey hypothesize that higher mortality rates of colonizers led to the establishment of institutions that were more extractive in nature (less protection against expropriation), and these institutions still persist today.\nUsing a scatterplot (Figure 3 in [AJR01]), we can see protection against expropriation is negatively correlated with settler mortality rates, coinciding with the authors’ hypothesis and satisfying the first condition of a valid instrument.\n# Dropping NA's is required to use numpy's polyfit df2 = df.dropna(subset=['logMort', 'Exprop']) X = df2['logMort'] y = df2['Exprop']  # Make new figure 2 def make_new_figure_2(): # Init figure fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1) ax.set_title('Figure 3: First-stage') # Fit a linear trend line sns.regplot(x=X, y=y, ax=ax, order=1, scatter=True, ci=None, line_kws={\u0026quot;color\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;r\u0026quot;}) ax.set_xlim([1.8,8.4]) ax.set_ylim([3.3,10.4]) ax.set_xlabel('Log of Settler Mortality') ax.set_ylabel('Average Expropriation Risk 1985-95');  make_new_figure_2()  The second condition may not be satisfied if settler mortality rates in the 17th to 19th centuries have a direct effect on current GDP (in addition to their indirect effect through institutions).\nFor example, settler mortality rates may be related to the current disease environment in a country, which could affect current economic performance.\n[AJR01] argue this is unlikely because:\n The majority of settler deaths were due to malaria and yellow fever and had a limited effect on local people. The disease burden on local people in Africa or India, for example, did not appear to be higher than average, supported by relatively high population densities in these areas before colonization.  As we appear to have a valid instrument, we can use 2SLS regression to obtain consistent and unbiased parameter estimates.\nFirst stage The first stage involves regressing the endogenous variable ($ {Exprop}_i $) on the instrument.\nThe instrument is the set of all exogenous variables in our model (and not just the variable we have replaced).\nUsing model 1 as an example, our instrument is simply a constant and settler mortality rates $ {logMort}_i $.\nTherefore, we will estimate the first-stage regression as\n$$ {Exprop}_i = \\delta_0 + \\delta_1 {logMort}_i + v_i $$\n# Add a constant variable df['const'] = 1 # Fit the first stage regression and print summary results_fs = sm.OLS(df['Exprop'], df.loc[:,['const', 'logMort']], missing='drop').fit() results_fs.summary()  OLS Regression Results  Dep.

The distribution function (also called cumulative distribution function) of $X$, commonly denoted $F_X(x)$ is defined by $$ F_X(x) = \\Pr(X \\leq x) $$\n Properties\n $F$ is monotone non-decreasing $F$ is right continuous $\\lim _ {x \\to - \\infty} F(x)=0$ and $\\lim _ {x \\to + \\infty} F(x)=1$   The random variables $(X_1, .. , X_n)$ are independent if and only if $$ F _ {(X_1, \u0026hellip; , X_n)} (x) = \\prod _ {i=1}^n F_{X_i} (x_i) \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb R^n $$\nDensity Function Let $X$ be a real valued random variable. $X$ has a probability density function if there exists $f_X(x)$ such that for all measurable $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, $$ P(X \\in A) = \\int_A f_X(x) \\mathrm{d} x $$\nMoments Expected Value The expected value of a random variable, when it exists, is given by $$ \\mathbb{E}[ X ] = \\int_ \\Omega X(\\omega) \\mathrm{d} P $$ When $X$ has a density, then $$ \\mathbb{E} [ X ] = \\int_ \\mathbb{R} x f_X (x) \\mathrm{d} x = \\int _ \\mathbb{R} x \\mathrm{d} F_X (x) $$\nThe empirical expectation (or sample average) is given by $$ \\mathbb{E}_n [x_i] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^N x_i $$\nVariance and Covariance The covariance of two random variables $X$, $Y$ defined on $\\Omega$ is $$ Cov(X, Y ) = \\mathbb{E}[ (X - \\mathbb{E}[ X ]) (Y - \\mathbb{E}[ Y ]) ] = \\mathbb{E}[XY ] - \\mathbb{E}[ X ]E[ Y ] $$ In vector notation, $Cov(X, Y) = \\mathbb{E}[XY'] - \\mathbb{E}[ X ]\\mathbb{E}[Y']$.\nThe variance of a random variable $X$, when it exists, is given by $$ Var(X) = \\mathbb{E}[ (X - \\mathbb{E}[ X ])^2 ] = \\mathbb{E}[X^2] - \\mathbb{E}[ X ]^2 $$ In vector notation, $Var(X) = \\mathbb{E}[XX'] - \\mathbb{E}[ X ]\\mathbb{E}[X']$.\nProperties Let $X, Y, Z, T \\in \\mathcal{L}^{2}$ and $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n $Cov(X, X) = Var(X)$ $Cov(X, Y) = Cov(Y, X)$ $Cov(aX + b, Y) = a \\ Cov(X,Y)$ $Cov(X+Z, Y) = Cov(X,Y) + Cov(Z,Y)$ $Cov(aX + bZ, cY + dT) = ac * Cov(X,Y) + ad * Cov(X,T) + bc * Cov(Z,Y) + bd * Cov(Z,T)$  Let $X, Y \\in \\mathcal L^1$ be independent. Then, $\\mathbb E[XY] = \\mathbb E[ X ] \\mathbb E[ Y ]$.\nIf $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $Cov(X,Y) = 0$.\n Note that the converse does not hold: $Cov(X,Y) = 0 \\not \\to X \\perp Y$.\n Sample Variance The sample variance is given by $$ Var_n (x_i) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^N (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 $$ where $\\bar{x_i} = \\mathbb{E}_n [x_i] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^N x_i$.\nFinite Sample Bias Theorem Theorem: The expected sample variance $\\mathbb{E} [\\sigma^2_n] = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^N \\left(y_i - \\mathbb{E}_n[ Y ] \\right)^2 \\right]$ gives an estimate of the population variance that is biased by a factor of $\\frac{1}{n}$ and is therefore referred to as biased sample variance.\nProof: $$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp;\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma^2_n] = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\mathbb{E}_n [ Y ] \\right)^2 \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n y_i \\right )^2 \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\mathbb{E} \\left[ y_i^2 - \\frac{2}{n} y_i \\sum _ {j=1}^n y_j + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum _ {j=1}^n y_j \\sum _ {k=1}^{n}y_k \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\left[ \\frac{n-2}{n} \\mathbb{E}[y_i^2] - \\frac{2}{n} \\sum _ {j\\neq i} \\mathbb{E}[y_i y_j] + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum _ {j=1}^n \\sum _ {k\\neq j} \\mathbb{E}[y_j y_k] + \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum _ {j=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[y_j^2] \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\left[ \\frac{n-2}{n}(\\mu^2 + \\sigma^2) - \\frac{2}{n} (n-1) \\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} n(n-1)\\mu^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} n (\\mu^2 + \\sigma^2)]\\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{n-1}{n} \\sigma^2 \\end{aligned} $$ $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nInequalities   Triangle Inequality: if $\\mathbb{E} [ X ] \u0026lt; \\infty$, then $$ |\\mathbb{E} [ X ] | \\leq \\mathbb{E} [|X|] $$\n  Markov’s Inequality: if $\\mathbb{E}[ X ] \u0026lt; \\infty$, then $$ \\Pr(|X| \u0026gt; t) \\leq \\frac{1}{t} \\mathbb{E}[|X|] $$\n  Chebyshev’s Inequality: if $\\mathbb{E}[X^2] \u0026lt; \\infty$, then $$ \\Pr(|X- \\mu|\u0026gt; t \\sigma) \\leq \\frac{1}{t^2}\\Leftrightarrow \\Pr(|X- \\mu|\u0026gt; t ) \\leq \\frac{\\sigma^2}{t^2} $$\n  Cauchy-Schwarz’s Inequality: $$ \\mathbb{E} [|XY|] \\leq \\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[X^2] \\mathbb{E}[Y^2]} $$\n  Minkowski Inequality: $$ \\left( \\sum _ {k=1}^n | x_k + y_k |^p \\right) ^ {\\frac{1}{p}} \\leq \\left( \\sum _ {k=1}^n | x_k |^p \\right) ^ {\\frac{1}{p}} + \\left( \\sum _ {k=1}^n | y_k | ^p \\right) ^ { \\frac{1}{p} } $$\n  Jensen’s Inequality: if $g( \\cdot)$ is concave (e.g. logarithmic function), then $$ \\mathbb{E}[g(x)] \\leq g(\\mathbb{E}[ X ]) $$ Similarly, if $g(\\cdot)$ is convex (e.g. exponential function), then $$ \\mathbb{E}[g(x)] \\geq g(\\mathbb{E}[ X ]) $$\n  Law of Iterated Expectations Theorem (Law of Iterated Expectations) $$ \\mathbb{E}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}_X [\\mathbb{E}(Y|X)] $$ \u0026gt; This states that the expectation of the conditional expectation is the unconditional expectation. \u0026gt; \u0026gt; In other words the average of the conditional averages is the unconditional average.\nLaw of Total Variance Theorem (Law of Total Variance) $$ Var(Y) = Var_X (\\mathbb{E}[Y |X]) + \\mathbb{E}_X [Var(Y|X)] $$\nSince variances are always non-negative, the law of total variance implies $$ Var(Y) \\geq Var_X (\\mathbb{E}[Y |X]) $$\nDistributions Normal Distribution We say that a random variable $Z$ has the standard normal distribution, or Gaussian, written $Z \\sim N(0,1)$, if it has the density $$ \\phi(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\right), \\quad-\\infty\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;\\infty $$ If $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$ and $X = \\mu + \\sigma Z$ for $\\mu \\in \\mathbb R$ and $\\sigma \\geq 0$, then $X$ has a univariate normal distribution, written $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$. By change-of-variables X has the density $$ f(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^{2}}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^{2}}{2 \\sigma^{2}}\\right), \\quad-\\infty\u0026lt;x\u0026lt;\\infty $$\nMultinomial Normal Distribution We say that the k -vector Z has a multivariate standard normal distribution, written $Z \\sim N(0, I_k)$ if it has the joint density $$ f(x)=\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{k / 2}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{x^{\\prime} x}{2}\\right), \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k} $$ If $Z \\sim N(0, I_k)$ and $X = \\mu + B Z$, then the k-vector $X$ has a multivariate normal distribution, written $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ where $\\Sigma = BB' \\geq 0$. If $\\sigma \u0026gt; 0$, then by change-of-variables $X$ has the joint density function $$ f(x)=\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{k / 2} \\operatorname{det}(\\Sigma)^{1 / 2}} \\exp \\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^{\\prime} \\Sigma^{-1}(x-\\mu)}{2}\\right), \\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k} $$\nProperties  The expectation and covariance matrix of $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ are $\\mathbb E = \\mu$ and $Var=\\Sigma$. If $(X,Y)$ are multivariate normal, $X$ and $Y$ are uncorrelated if and only if they are independent. If $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ and $Y = a + bB$, then $X \\sim N(a + B\\mu, B \\Sigma B')$. If $X \\sim N(0, I_k)$, then $X\u0026rsquo;X \\sim \\chi^2_k$, chi-square with $k$ degrees of freedom. If $X \\sim N(0, \\Sigma)$ with $\\Sigma\u0026gt;0$, then $X' \\Sigma X \\sim \\chi_k$ where $k = \\dim (X)$. If $Z \\sim N(0,1)$ and $Q \\sim \\chi^2_k$ are independent then $\\frac{Z}{\\sqrt{Q/k}} \\sim t_k$, student t with k degrees of freedom.  Normal Distribution Relatives These distributions are relatives of the normal distribution\n $\\chi^2_q \\sim \\sum _ {i=1}^q Z_i^2$ where $Z_i \\sim N(0,1)$ $t_n \\sim \\frac{Z}{\\sqrt{\\chi^2 _ n}/n }$ $F(n_1 , n_2) \\sim \\frac{\\chi^2 _ {n_1} / n_1}{\\chi^2 _ {n_2}/n_2}$   The $t$ distribution is approximately standard normal but has heavier tails.

We can instead use step functions in order to avoid imposing such a global structure.\nFor example, we could break the range of age into bins, and fit a different constant in each bin.\nStep Functions Building a step function means first picking $K$ cutpoints $c_1 , c_2 , . . . , c_K$ in the range of age, and then construct $K + 1$ new variables\n$$ C_0(age) = \\mathbb I ( age \u0026lt; c_1) \\ C_1(age) = \\mathbb I ( c_1 \u0026lt; age \u0026lt; c_2) \\ C_2(age) = \\mathbb I ( c_2 \u0026lt; age \u0026lt; c_3) \\ \u0026hellip; \\ C_{K-1}(age) = \\mathbb I ( c_{K-1} \u0026lt; age \u0026lt; c_K) \\ C_K(age) = \\mathbb I ( c_K \u0026lt; age) \\ $$\nwhere $\\mathbb I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function.\nBinning First, we generate the cuts.\n# Generate cuts for the variable age df_cut, bins = pd.cut(df.age, 4, retbins=True, right=True) df_cut.value_counts(sort=False) type(df_cut)  pandas.core.series.Series  Let\u0026rsquo;s generate a DataFrame out of this series.\n# Generate bins for \u0026quot;age\u0026quot; from the cuts df_steps = pd.concat([df.age, df_cut, df.wage], keys=['age','age_cuts','wage'], axis=1) df_steps.head(5)   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  age age_cuts wage     231655 18 (17.938, 33.5] 75.043154   86582 24 (17.938, 33.5] 70.476020   161300 45 (33.5, 49.0] 130.982177   155159 43 (33.5, 49.0] 154.685293   11443 50 (49.0, 64.5] 75.043154     Dummy Variables Now we can generate different dummy variables out of each bin.\n# Create dummy variables for the age groups df_steps_dummies = pd.get_dummies(df_steps['age_cuts']) # Statsmodels requires explicit adding of a constant (intercept) df_steps_dummies = sm.add_constant(df_steps_dummies) df_steps_dummies.head(5)   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  const (17.938, 33.5] (33.5, 49.0] (49.0, 64.5] (64.5, 80.0]     231655 1.0 1 0 0 0   86582 1.0 1 0 0 0   161300 1.0 0 1 0 0   155159 1.0 0 1 0 0   11443 1.0 0 0 1 0     Stepwise Regression We are now ready to run our regression\n# Generate our new X variable X_step = df_steps_dummies.drop(df_steps_dummies.columns[1], axis=1) # OLS Regression on step functions ols_step = sm.OLS(y, X_step).fit() ols_step.summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   const  94.1584  1.476  63.790  0.000  91.264  97.053   (33.5, 49.0]  24.0535  1.829  13.148  0.000  20.466  27.641   (49.0, 64.5]  23.6646  2.068  11.443  0.000  19.610  27.719   (64.5, 80.0]  7.6406  4.987  1.532  0.126  -2.139  17.420   From the regression outcome we can see that most bin coefficients are significant, except for the last one.\n# Put the test data in the same bins as the training data. bin_mapping = np.digitize(x_grid.ravel(), bins) bin_mapping  array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4])  # Get dummies, drop first dummy category, add constant X_step_test = sm.add_constant(pd.get_dummies(bin_mapping).drop(1, axis=1)) X_step_test.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  const 2 3 4     0 1.0 0 0 0   1 1.0 0 0 0   2 1.0 0 0 0   3 1.0 0 0 0   4 1.0 0 0 0     # Step prediction y_hat2 = ols_step.predict(X_step_test)  Logistic Step Regression We are going again to run a logistic regression, given that our outcome is binary.\n# Logistic regression on step functions logit_step = sm.GLM(y01, X_step, family=logit_link).fit() y01_hat2 = logit_step.predict(X_step_test) logit_step.summary().tables[1]    coef std err z P|z| [0.025 0.975]   const  -5.0039  0.449  -11.152  0.000  -5.883  -4.124   (33.5, 49.0]  1.5998  0.474  3.378  0.001  0.672  2.528   (49.0, 64.5]  1.7147  0.488  3.512  0.000  0.758  2.672   (64.5, 80.0]  0.7413  1.102  0.672  0.501  -1.420  2.902   Plotting How does the predicted function looks like?\nplot_predictions(X, y, x_grid, y01, y_hat2, y01_hat2, 'Figure 7.2: Piecewise Constant')  Regression Splines Spline regression, or piece-wise polynomial regression, involves fitting separate low-degree polynomials over different regions of $X$. The idea is to have one regression specification but with different coefficients in different parts of the $X$ range. The points where the coefficients change are called knots.\nFor example, we could have a third degree polynomial and splitting the sample in two.\n$$ y_{i}=\\left{\\begin{array}{ll} \\beta_{01}+\\beta_{11} x_{i}+\\beta_{21} x_{i}^{2}+\\beta_{31} x_{i}^{3}+\\epsilon_{i} \u0026amp; \\text { if } x_{i}\u0026lt;c \\ \\beta_{02}+\\beta_{12} x_{i}+\\beta_{22} x_{i}^{2}+\\beta_{32} x_{i}^{3}+\\epsilon_{i} \u0026amp; \\text { if } x_{i} \\geq c \\end{array}\\right. $$\nWe have now two sets of coefficients, one for each subsample.\nGenerally, using more knots leads to a more flexible piecewise polynomial. Also increasing the degree of the polynomial increases the degree of flexibility.\nExample We are now going to plot 4 different examples for the age wage relationship:\n Discontinuous piecewise cubic Continuous piecewise cubic Quadratic (continuous) Continuous piecewise linear  # Cut dataset df_short = df.iloc[:80,:] X_short = df_short.age y_short = df_short.wage x_grid_short = np.arange(df_short.age.min(), df_short.age.max()+1).reshape(-1,1) # 1.

Unless we expect a sudden wage jump at a certain age, we would like the function to be continuous. However, if for example we split age around the retirement age, we might expect a discontinuity.\nThe second example (top right) makes us think on why would we want out function not to be differentiable. Unless we have some specific mechanism in mind, ususally there is a trade-off between making the function non-differentiable or increasing the degree of the polynomial, as the last two examples show us. We get a similar fit with a quadratic fit or a discontinuous linear fit. The main difference is that in the second case we are picking the discontinuity point by hand instead of letting the data choose how to change the slope of the curve.\nThe Spline Basis Representation How can we fit a piecewise degree-d polynomial under the constraint that it (and possibly its first d − 1 derivatives) be continuous?\nThe most direct way to represent a cubic spline is to start off with a basis for a cubic polynomial—namely, x,x2,x3—and then add one truncated power basis function per knot. A truncated power basis function is defined as\n$$ h(x, c)=(x-c)_{+}^{3} = \\Bigg{\\begin{array}{cl} (x-c)^{3} \u0026amp; \\text { if } x\u0026gt;c \\ 0 \u0026amp; \\text { otherwise } \\end{array} $$\nOne can show that adding a term of the form $\\beta_4 h(x, c)$ to the model for a cubic polynomial will lead to a discontinuity in only the third derivative at $c$; the function will remain continuous, with continuous first and second derivatives, at each of the knots.\nCubic Splines One way to specify the spline is using nodes and degrees of freedom.\n# Specifying 3 knots and 3 degrees of freedom spline5 = \u0026quot;bs(x, knots=(25,40,60), degree=3, include_intercept=False)\u0026quot; pred5 = fit_predict_spline(spline5, X, y, x_grid)  No Knots When we fit a spline, where should we place the knots?\nThe regression spline is most flexible in regions that contain a lot of knots, because in those regions the polynomial coefficients can change rapidly. Hence, one option is to place more knots in places where we feel the function might vary most rapidly, and to place fewer knots where it seems more stable. While this option can work well, in practice it is common to place knots in a uniform fashion. One way to do this is to specify the desired degrees of freedom, and then have the software automatically place the corresponding number of knots at uniform quantiles of the data.\n# Specifying degree 3 and 6 degrees of freedom spline6 = \u0026quot;bs(x, df=6, degree=3, include_intercept=False)\u0026quot; pred6 = fit_predict_spline(spline6, X, y, x_grid)  Natural Splines A natural spline is a regression spline with additional boundary constraints: the function is required to be linear at the boundary (in the region where X is smaller than the smallest knot, or larger than the largest knot). This addi- tional constraint means that natural splines generally produce more stable estimates at the boundaries.\n# Natural spline with 4 degrees of freedom spline7 = \u0026quot;cr(x, df=4)\u0026quot; pred7 = fit_predict_spline(spline7, X, y, x_grid)  Comparison # Compare predictons preds = [pred5, pred6, pred7] labels = ['degree 3, knots 3', 'degree 3, degrees of freedom 3', 'natural, degrees of freedom 4'] compare_predictions(X, y, x_grid, preds, labels)  Comparison to Polynomial Regression Regression splines often give superior results to polynomial regression. This is because unlike polynomials, which must use a high degree to produce flexible fits, splines introduce flexibility by increasing the number of knots but keeping the degree fixed.\nWe are now fitting a polynomial of degree 15 and a spline with 15 degrees of freedom.\n# Polynomial of degree 15 X_poly15 = PolynomialFeatures(15).fit_transform(df.age.values.reshape(-1,1)) ols_poly_15 = sm.OLS(y, X_poly15).fit() pred8 = ols_poly_15.predict(PolynomialFeatures(15).fit_transform(x_grid)) # Spline with 15 degrees of freedon spline9 = \u0026quot;bs(x, df=15, degree=3, include_intercept=False)\u0026quot; pred9 = fit_predict_spline(spline9, X, y, x_grid)  Plotting # Compare predictons preds = [pred8, pred9] labels = ['Polynomial', 'Spline'] compare_predictions(X, y, x_grid, preds, labels)  As we can see, despite the two regressions having the same degrees of freedom, the polynomial fit is much more volatile. We can compare them along some dimensions.\nLocal Regression So far we have looked at so-called \u0026ldquo;global methods\u0026quot;: methods that try to fit a unique function specification over the whole data. The function specification can be complex, as in the case of splines, but can be expressed globally.\nLocal regression is a different approach for fitting flexible non-linear functions, which involves computing the fit at a target point $x_0$ using only the nearby training observations.\nDetails How does local regression work?\nIngredients: $X$, $y$.\nHow to you output a prediction $\\hat y_i$ at a new point $x_i$?\n Take a number of points in $X$ close to $x_i$: $X_{\\text{close-to-i}}$ Assign a weight to each of there points Fit a weigthed least squares regression of $X_{\\text{close-to-i}}$ on $y_{\\text{close-to-i}}$ Use the estimated coefficients $\\hat \\beta$ to predict $\\hat y_i = \\hat \\beta_0 + \\hat \\beta_1 x_i$  Generate Data # Set seed np.random.seed(1) # Generate data X_sim = np.sort(np.random.uniform(0,1,100)) e = np.random.uniform(-.5,.5,100) y_sim = -4*X_sim**2 + 3*X_sim + e # True Generating process without noise X_grid = np.linspace(0,1,100) y_grid = -4*X_grid**2 + 3*X_grid  Plotting Let\u0026rsquo;s visualize the simulated data and the curve without noise.\nplot_simulated_data(X_sim, y_sim, X_grid, y_grid);  Fit LL Regression Now we fit a local linear regression.\n# Settings spec = 'll' bandwidth = 0.1 kernel = 'gaussian' # Locally linear regression local_reg = KernelReg(y_sim, X_sim.reshape(-1,1), var_type='c', reg_type=spec, bw=[bandwidth]) y_hat = KernelReg.fit(local_reg)  What do the parameters mean?\n var_type: dependent variable type (c i.e. continuous) reg_type: local regression specification (ll i.e. locally linear) bw : bandwidth length (0.1) ckertype: kernel type (gaussian)  Prediction What does the prediction looks like?\nfig, ax = plot_simulated_data(X_sim, y_sim, X_grid, y_grid); make_figure_7_9a(fig, ax, X_sim, y_hat);  Details How exactly was the prediction generated?

The main limitation of GAMs is that the model is restricted to be additive. With many variables, important interactions can be missed. However, as with linear regression, we can manually add interaction terms to the GAM model by including additional predictors of the form $X_j \\times X_k$.\nGAMs for Classification Problems We can use GAMs also with a binary dependent variable.\n# Binary dependent variable y_binary = (y\u0026gt;250) ## Logit link function logit_gam = LogisticGAM(s(0, n_splines=8) + s(1, n_splines=10) + f(2), fit_intercept=True) logit_gam.gridsearch(X, y_binary);  100% (11 of 11) |########################| Elapsed Time: 0:00:00 Time: 0:00:00  Plotting plot_gam(logit_gam)  The results are qualitatively similar to the non-binary case.\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"0f8ac3b5f6c7bc841b2b14305295ef5f","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/ml-econ/03_nonparametric/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/ml-econ/03_nonparametric/","section":"course","summary":"# Setup %matplotlib inline from utils.lecture03 import *  Dataset For this session, we are mostly going to work with the wage dataset.\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/Wage.csv', index_col=0) df.head(3)   .","tags":null,"title":"Non-Parametric Regression","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Convergence Sequences A sequence of nonrandom numbers $\\lbrace a_n \\rbrace$ converges to $a$ (has limit $a$) if for all $\\varepsilon\u0026gt;0$, there exists $n _ \\varepsilon$ such that if $n \u0026gt; n_ \\varepsilon$, then $|a_n - a| \u0026lt; \\varepsilon$.

The sum $x_1 + \u0026hellip; + X_n$ has mean $n \\mu$ and variance $n \\sigma^2$.\nConsider the random variable $$ Z_n = \\frac{x_1 + \u0026hellip; + X_n - n\\mu}{\\sqrt{n \\sigma^2}} = \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\frac{x_i - \\mu}{\\sqrt{n \\sigma^2}} = \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\tilde x_i $$\nwhere in the last step we defined the new random variables $\\tilde x_i = \\frac{x_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}$ each with zero mean and unit variance.

The right hand side equals the characteristic function of a standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$, which implies through Lévy’s continuity theorem that the distribution of $Z_ n$ will approach $N(0,1)$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the sum $x_1 + \u0026hellip; + x_n$ will approach that of the normal distribution $N(n_{\\mu}, n\\sigma^2)$, and the sample average $$ \\mathbb{E}_n [x_i] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n x_i $$\nconverges to the normal distribution $N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, from which the central limit theorem follows. $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nDelta Method Let $\\lbrace X_n \\rbrace$ be a sequence of independent, identically distributed $K \\times 1$ random vectors such that\n $\\sqrt{n} (X_n - c) \\overset{d}{\\to} Z$ for some fixed $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$ and $\\Sigma$ a $K \\times K$ positive definite matrix.

It is natural to ask: exactly how long a time do the images of such recurrent points spend in $A$? The precise formulation of the problem runs as follows: given a point $x$ (for present purposes it does not matter whether $x$ is in $A$ or not), and given a positive integer $n$, form the ratio of the number of these points that belong to $A$ to the total number (i.e., to $n$), and evaluate the limit of these ratios as $n$ tends to infinity. It is, of course, not at all obvious in what sense, if any, that limit exists.

The validity of this condition for all $G$ and $H$ is, in fact, equivalent to ergodicity. To prove this, suppose that $A$ is a measurable invariant set, and take both $G$ and $H$ equal to $A$. It follows that $\\Pr(A) = (\\Pr(A))^2$, and hence that $\\Pr(A)$ is either 0 or 1.\nComment 2 The Cesaro convergence condition has a natural intuitive interpretation. We may visualize the transformation $T$ as a particular way of stirring the contents of a vessel (of total volume 1) full of an incompressible fluid, which may be thought of as 90 per cent gin ($G$) and 10 per cent vermouth ($H$). If $H$ is the region originally occupied by the vermouth, then, for any part $G$ of the vessel, the relative amount of vermouth in $G$, after $n$ repetitions of the act of stirring, is given by $\\Pr(T^{-n}G \\cap H)/\\Pr(H)$. The ergodicity of $T$ implies therefore that on the average this relative amount is exactly equal to 10 per cent. In general, in physical situations like this one, one expects to be justified in making a much stronger statement, namely that, after the liquid has been stirred sufficiently often ($n \\to \\infty$), every part $G$ of the container will contain approximately 10 per cent vermouth. In mathematical language this expectation amounts to replacing Cesaro convergence by ordinary convergence, i.e., to the condition $\\lim_ {n\\to \\infty} \\Pr(T^{-n}G \\cap H) = \\Pr(G)\\Pr(H)$. If a transformation $T$ satisfies this condition for every pair $G$ and $H$ of measurable sets, it is called mixing, or, in distinction from a related but slightly weaker concept, strongly mixing.”\nMixing Let $\\lbrace\\Omega, \\mathcal{B}, P \\rbrace$ be a probability space. Let $T$ be a probability preserving transform.

The validation set approach is a very simple strategy for this task. It involves randomly dividing the available set of observations into two parts\n a training set and a validation set or hold-out set  The model is fit on the training set, and the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in the validation set. The resulting validation set error rate-typically assessed using MSE in the case of a quantitative response—provides an estimate of the test error rate.\nIn the following example we are are going to compute the MSE fit polynomial of different order (one to ten). We are going to split the data 50-50 across training and test set.\n# Cross-validation function for polynomials def cv_poly(X, y, p_order, r_states, t_prop): start = time.time() # Init scores scores = np.zeros((p_order.size,r_states.size)) # Generate 10 random splits of the dataset for j in r_states: # Split sample in train and test X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=t_prop, random_state=j) # For every polynomial degree for i in p_order: # Generate polynomial X_train_poly = PolynomialFeatures(i+1).fit_transform(X_train) X_test_poly = PolynomialFeatures(i+1).fit_transform(X_test) # Fit regression ols = LinearRegression().fit(X_train_poly, y_train) pred = ols.predict(X_test_poly) scores[i,j]= mean_squared_error(y_test, pred) print('Time elapsed: %.4f seconds' % (time.time()-start)) return scores  # Init t_prop = 0.5 p_order = np.arange(10) r_states = np.arange(10) # Get X,y X = df1.horsepower.values.reshape(-1,1) y = df1.mpg.ravel() # Compute scores cv_scores = cv_poly(X, y, p_order, r_states, t_prop)  Time elapsed: 0.0277 seconds  Let\u0026rsquo;s test the score for polynomials of different orders.\n# Figure 5.2 def make_figure_5_2(): # Init fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(14,6)) fig.suptitle('Figure 5.2') # Left plot (first split) ax1.plot(p_order+1,cv_scores[:,0], '-o') ax1.set_title('Random split of the data set') # Right plot (all splits) ax2.plot(p_order+1,cv_scores) ax2.set_title('10 random splits of the data set') for ax in fig.axes: ax.set_ylabel('Mean Squared Error') ax.set_ylim(15,30) ax.set_xlabel('Degree of Polynomial') ax.set_xlim(0.5,10.5) ax.set_xticks(range(2,11,2));  make_figure_5_2()  This figure illustrates a first drawback of the validation approach: the estimate of the test error rate can be highly variable, depending on precisely which observations are included in the training set and which observations are included in the validation set.\nThe second drawback of the validation approach is that only a subset of the observations—those that are included in the training set rather than in the validation set—are used to fit the model. Since statistical methods tend to per- form worse when trained on fewer observations, this suggests that the validation set error rate may tend to overestimate the test error rate for the model fit on the entire data set.\nLeave-One-Out Cross-Validation Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) attempts to address that method’s drawbacks.\nLike the validation set approach, LOOCV involves splitting the set of observations into two parts. However, instead of creating two subsets of comparable size, a single observation $i$ is used for the validation set, and the remaining $n-1$ observations make up the training set. The statistical learning method is fit on the $n−1$ training observations and the MSE is computed using the excluded observation $i$. The procedure is repeated $n$ times, for $i=1,\u0026hellip;,n$.\nThe LOOCV estimate for the test MSE is the average of these $n$ test error estimates:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}{(n)}=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{MSE}_{i} $$\nLOOCV has a couple of major advantages over the validation set approach.\nFirst, it has far less bias. In LOOCV, we repeatedly fit the statistical learning method using training sets that contain $n − 1$ observations, almost as many as are in the entire data set. However, this also means that LOOCV is more computationally intense.\nSecond, in contrast to the validation approach which will yield different results when applied repeatedly due to randomness in the training/validation set splits, performing LOOCV multiple times will always yield the same results: there is no randomness in the training/validation set splits.\n# LeaveOneOut CV function for polynomials def loo_cv_poly(X, y, p_order): start = time.time() # Init loo = LeaveOneOut().get_n_splits(y) loo_scores = np.zeros((p_order.size,1)) # For every polynomial degree for i in p_order: # Generate polynomial X_poly = PolynomialFeatures(i+1).fit_transform(X) # Get score loo_scores[i] = cross_val_score(LinearRegression(), X_poly, y, cv=loo, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error').mean() print('Time elapsed: %.4f seconds' % (time.time()-start)) return loo_scores  Let\u0026rsquo;s compare the validation set approach against LOO in terms of computational time.\n# Validation set approach cv_scores = cv_poly(X, y, p_order, r_states, t_prop) # Leave One Out CV loo_scores = loo_cv_poly(X, y, p_order)  Time elapsed: 0.0270 seconds Time elapsed: 1.1495 seconds  As expected, LOOCV is much more computationally intense. Even accounting for the fact that we repeat every the validation set approach 10 times.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now compare them in terms of accuracy in minimizing the MSE.\n# Make new figure 1 def make_new_figure_1(): # Init fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(7,6)) # Left plot ax.plot(p_order+1, np.array(loo_scores)*-1, '-o', label='LOOCV') ax.plot(p_order+1, np.mean(cv_scores, axis=1), '-o', c='orange', label='Standard CV') ax.set_ylabel('Mean Squared Error'); ax.set_xlabel('Degree of Polynomial'); ax.set_ylim(15,30); ax.set_xlim(0.5,10.5); ax.set_xticks(range(2,11,2)); ax.legend();  make_new_figure_1()  With least squares linear or polynomial regression, an amazing shortcut makes the cost of LOOCV the same as that of a single model fit! The following formula holds:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}{(n)}=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{y_{i}-\\hat{y}{i}}{1-h{i}}\\right)^{2} $$\nwhere $\\hat y_i$ is the $i^{th}$ fitted value from the original least squares fit, and $h_i$ is the leverage of observation $i$.\nk-Fold Cross-Validation An alternative to LOOCV is k-fold CV. This approach involves the following steps:\n Randomly dividing the set of observations into $k$ groups, or folds, of approximately equal size. The first fold is treated as a validation set, and the method is fit on the remaining $k − 1$ folds. The mean squared error, MSE1, is then computed on the observations in the held-out fold. Steps (1)-(3) are repeated $k$ times; each time, a different group of observations is treated as a validation set.  The k-fold CV estimate is computed by averaging these values\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}{(k)}=\\frac{1}{k} \\sum{i=1}^{k} \\mathrm{MSE}_{i} $$\nLOOCV is a special case of k-fold CV in which $k$ is set to equal $n$. In practice, one typically performs k-fold CV using $k = 5$ or $k = 10$.\nThe most obvious advantage is computational. LOOCV requires fitting the statistical learning method $n$ times, while k-fold CV only requires $k$ splits.\n# 10fold CV function for polynomials def k10_cv_poly(X, y, p_order, r_states, folds): start = time.time() # Init k10_scores = np.zeros((p_order.size,r_states.size)) # Generate 10 random splits of the dataset for j in r_states: # For every polynomial degree for i in p_order: # Generate polynomial X_poly = PolynomialFeatures(i+1).fit_transform(X) # Split sample in train and test kf10 = KFold(n_splits=folds, shuffle=True, random_state=j) k10_scores[i,j] = cross_val_score(LinearRegression(), X_poly, y, cv=kf10, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error').mean() print('Time elapsed: %.4f seconds' % (time.time()-start)) return k10_scores  Let\u0026rsquo;s now compare 10 fold cross-validation with LOO in terms of computational time.\n# Leave One Out CV loo_scores = loo_cv_poly(X, y, p_order) # 10-fold CV folds = 10 k10_scores = k10_cv_poly(X, y, p_order, r_states, folds)  Time elapsed: 1.1153 seconds Time elapsed: 0.3078 seconds  Indeed we see that the LOOCV approach is more computationally intense. Even accounting for the fact that we repeat every 10-fold cross-validation 10 times.\nWe can now compare all the methods in terms of accuracy.\n# Figure 5.4 def make_figure_5_4(): fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(17,5)) fig.suptitle('Figure 5.4') # Left plot ax1.plot(p_order+1, np.array(loo_scores)*-1, '-o') ax1.set_title('LOOCV', fontsize=12) # Center plot ax2.plot(p_order+1,k10_scores*-1) ax2.set_title('10-fold CV', fontsize=12) # Right plot ax3.plot(p_order+1, np.array(loo_scores)*-1, '-o', label='LOOCV') ax3.plot(p_order+1, np.mean(cv_scores, axis=1), label='Standard CV') ax3.plot(p_order+1,np.mean(k10_scores,axis=1)*-1, label='10-fold CV') ax3.set_title('Comparison', fontsize=12); ax3.legend(); for ax in fig.axes: ax.set_ylabel('Mean Squared Error') ax.set_ylim(15,30) ax.set_xlabel('Degree of Polynomial') ax.set_xlim(0.5,10.5) ax.set_xticks(range(2,11,2));  make_figure_5_4()  10-fold cross-validation outputs a very similar MSE with respect to LOOCV, but with considerably less computational time.\n4.2 The Bootstrap The bootstrap is a widely applicable and extremely powerful statistical tool that can be used to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical learning method. In the specific case of linear regression, this is not particularly useful since there exist a formula for the standard errors. However, there are many models (almost all actually) for which there exists no closed for solution to the estimator variance.\nIn pricinple, we would like to draw independent samples from the true data generating process and assessing the uncertainty of an estimator by comparing its values across the different samples. However, this is clearly unfeasible since we do not know the true data generating process.\nWith the bootstrap, rather than repeatedly obtaining independent data sets from the population, we instead obtain distinct data sets by repeatedly sampling observations from the original data set. The power of the bootstrap lies in the fact that it can be easily applied to a wide range of statistical learning methods, including some for which a measure of variability is otherwise difficult to obtain and is not automatically output by statistical software.\nWe are now going to assess its usefulness through simulation. Take the following model:\n$$ y_i = \\beta_0 \\cdot x_i + \\varepsilon_i $$\nwhere $\\beta_0 = 0.6$ and $\\varepsilon \\sim N(0,1)$. We are now going to assess the variance of the OLS estimator $\\hat \\beta$ with the standard formula, simulating different samples and with bootstrap.\n# Set seed np.random.seed(1) # Init simulations = 1000 N = 1000 beta_0 = 0.6 beta_sim = np.zeros((simulations,1)) # Generate X X = normal(0,3,N).reshape(-1,1) # Loop over simulations for i in range(simulations): # Generate y e = normal(0,1,N).reshape(-1,1) y = beta_0*X + e # Estimate beta OLS beta_sim[i] = inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ y  # Init Bootstrap beta_boot = np.zeros((simulations,1)) # Loop over simulations for i in range(simulations): # Sample y X_sample, y_sample = resample(X, y, random_state=i) # Estimate beta OLS beta_boot[i] = inv(X_sample.T @ X_sample) @ X_sample.T @ y_sample  We can first compare the means.\n# Print means print('True value : %.4f' % beta_0) print('Mean Simulations: %.4f' % np.mean(beta_sim)) print('Mean One Sample : %.4f' % beta_sim[-1]) print('Mean Boostrap : %.4f' % np.mean(beta_boot))  True value : 0.6000 Mean Simulations: 0.6003 Mean One Sample : 0.5815 Mean Boostrap : 0.5816  The mean of the bootstrap estimtor is quite off. But this is not its actual purpose: it is designed to assess the uncertainty of an estimator, not its value.\nNow we compare the variances.\n# Print variances print('True std : %.6f' % np.sqrt(inv(X.T @ X))) print('Std Simulations: %.6f' % np.std(beta_sim)) print('Std One Sample : %.6f' % np.sqrt(inv(X.T @ X) * np.var(y - beta_sim[-1]*X))) print('Std Boostrap : %.6f' % np.std(beta_boot))  True std : 0.010737 Std Simulations: 0.010830 Std One Sample : 0.010536 Std Boostrap : 0.010812  Bootstrap gets as close to the true standard deviation of the estimator as the simulation with the true data generating process. Impressive!\nWe can now have a visual inspection.\n# Figure 5.10 def make_figure_5_10(): fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(1,3,figsize=(14,6)) fig.suptitle('Figure 5.10') # Left plot ax1.hist(beta_sim, bins=10, edgecolor='black'); ax1.axvline(x=beta_0, color='r', label='beta_0') ax1.set_xlabel('beta simulated'); # Center plot ax2.hist(beta_boot, bins=10, color='orange', edgecolor='black'); ax2.axvline(x=beta_0, color='r', label='beta_0') ax2.set_xlabel('beta bootstrap'); # Right plot df_bootstrap = pd.DataFrame({'simulated': beta_sim.ravel(), 'bootstrap':beta_boot.ravel()}, index=range(simulations)) ax3 = sns.boxplot(data=df_bootstrap, width=0.5, linewidth=2); ax3.axhline(y=beta_0, color='r', label='beta_0');  make_figure_5_10()  As we can see, the bootstrap is a powerful tool to assess the uncertainty of an estimator.\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"55557b8d76a9ab6ec9e78a74df31ab53","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/ml-econ/04_crossvalidation/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/ml-econ/04_crossvalidation/","section":"course","summary":"# Remove warnings import warnings warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')  # Import import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import time from numpy.linalg import inv from numpy.random import normal from sklearn.","tags":null,"title":"Resampling Methods","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Statistical Models Definition A statistical model is a set of probability distributions $\\lbrace P \\rbrace$.\nMore precisely, a statistical model over data $D \\in \\mathcal{D}$ is a set of probability distribution over datasets $D$ which takes values in $\\mathcal{D}$.\nSuppose you have regression data $\\lbrace x_i , y_i \\rbrace _ {i=1}^N$ with $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ and $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

In words: not rejecting the null hypothesis, when it is false    The corresponding probability of a type I error is called size.\nThe corresponding probability of a type II error is called power (against the alternative P).\nType I Error and Test Size Test size is the probability of a Type I error, i.e. $$ \\Pr \\Big[ \\text{ Reject } H_0 \\Big| H_0 \\text{ is true } \\Big] = \\Pr \\Big[ T(D)=1 \\Big| P \\in \\mathcal K \\Big] $$ A primary goal of test construction is to limit the incidence of Type I error by bounding the size of the test.\n In the dominant approach to hypothesis testing the researcher pre-selects a significance level $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ and then selects the test so that its size is no larger than $\\alpha$.\n Type II Error and Power Test power is the probability of a Type II error, i.e. $$ \\Pr \\Big[ \\text{ Not Reject } H_0 \\Big| H_0 \\text{ is false } \\Big] = \\Pr \\Big[ T(D)=0 \\Big| P \\in \\mathcal K^C \\Big] $$\n In the dominant approach to hypothesis testing the goal of test construction is to have high power subject to the constraint that the size of the test is lower than the pre-specified significance level.\n Statistical Significance TBD\nP-Values Recap We now summarize the main features of hypothesis testing.\n Select a significance level $\\alpha$. Select a test statistic $T$ with asymptotic distribution $T\\to \\xi$ under $H_0$. Set the asymptotic critical value $c$ so that 1−G(c)=α, where G is the distribution function of $\\xi$. Calculate the asymptotic p-value p=1−G(T). Reject $H_0$ if T \u0026gt; c, or equivalently p \u0026lt; α. Accept $H_0$ if T ≤ c, or equivalently p ≥ α. Report $p$ to summarize the evidence concerning $H_0$ versus $H_1$.  Examples Let’s focus two hypotheses:\n $\\beta_k = c \\in \\mathbb R$ $\\boldsymbol R' \\beta = r \\in \\mathbb R^p$  t-test with Known Variance Consider the testing problem $H_0 : \\beta_k = c$, where $c$ is a pre-specified value under the null. Suppose the variance of the esimator $\\hat \\beta_k$ is known.\nThe t-statistic for this problem is defined by $$ n_{k}:=\\frac{\\hat \\beta_{k} - c}{\\sigma_{\\hat \\beta_{k}}} $$ In the testing procedure above, the sampling distribution under the null $H_0$ is given by $$ n_k \\sim N(0,1) $$ Where $N(0,1)$ the standard normal distribution.\nt-test with Unknown Variance Consider the testing problem $H_0 : \\beta_k = c$, where $c$ is a presepecified value under the null. In case the variance of the estimator $\\hat \\beta_k$ is not known, we have to replace it with a consistent estimate $\\hat \\sigma^2_{\\hat \\beta}$\nThe t-statistic for this problem is defined by $$ t_{k}:=\\frac{\\hat \\beta_{k} - c}{\\hat \\sigma_{\\hat \\beta_{k}}} $$ In the testing procedure above, the sampling distribution under the null $H_0$ is given by $$ t_k \\sim t_{n-K} $$ Where $t_{n-K}$ denotes the t-distribution with $n-K$ degress of freedom.\nWald-test Consider the testing problem $\\boldsymbol R' \\beta = r$, where $\\boldsymbol R \\in \\mathbb R^{p+K}$ is a pre-specified set of linear combinations and $r \\in \\mathbb R^p$ is a restriction vector. Suppose the variance of the esimator $\\hat \\beta$ is known.\nThe Wald statistic for this problem is given by $$ W := \\frac{(R \\hat \\beta-r)^{\\prime}(R \\hat \\beta-r) }{R' \\sigma^{2}{\\hat \\beta} R} $$ In the testing procedure above, the sampling distribution under the null $H_0$ is given by $$ W \\sim \\chi^2{n-K} $$ Where $\\chi^2_{n-K}$ denotes the chi-squared distribution with $n-K$ degress of freedom.\nComments on the Wald test  The Wald statistic $W$ is a weighted Euclidean measure of the length of the vector $R \\hat \\beta-r$ The Wald test is intrinsecally 2-sided When $p=1$ then $W = |T|$ , the square of the t-statistic, so hypothesis tests based on $W$ and $|T|$ are equivalent.  F-test Consider the testing problem $\\boldsymbol R' \\beta = r$, where $\\boldsymbol R \\in \\mathbb R^{p+K}$ is a pre-specified set of linear combinations and $r \\in \\mathbb R^p$ is a restriction vector. In case the variance of the estimator $\\hat \\beta$ is not known, we have to replace it with a consistent estimate $\\hat \\sigma^2_{\\hat \\beta}$.\nThe F-statistic for this problem is given by $$ F := \\frac{(R \\hat \\beta-r)^{\\prime}(R \\hat \\beta-r) / p }{R' \\hat \\sigma^{2} _ {\\hat \\beta} R} $$ In the testing procedure above, the sampling distribution under the null $H_0$ is given by $$ F \\sim F_{p, n-K} $$ Where $F_{p, n-K}$ denotes the F-distribution with $n-K$ degress of freedom, with $p$ restrictions.\nF-test Equivalence Consider the testing problem $\\boldsymbol R' \\beta = r$, where $\\boldsymbol R \\in \\mathbb R^{p+K}$ is a pre-specified set of linear combinations and $r \\in \\mathbb R^p$ is a restriction vector. Consider two estimators\n $\\hat \\beta_U = \\arg \\min_b \\frac{1}{n} (y - X \\beta)' (y - X\\beta)$ $\\hat \\beta_R = \\arg \\min_{b : \\boldsymbol R' \\beta = r} \\frac{1}{n} (y - X \\beta)' (y - X\\beta)$  Then the F statistic is numerically equivalent to the following expression $$ F = \\frac{\\left(S S R_{R}-S S R_{U}\\right) / p}{S S R_{U} /(n-K)} $$ where SSR is the sum of squared residuals.\nConfidence Intervals TBD\nMinimum Distance Tests TBD\nAsymptotics Estimator Properties Given a sequence of well specified data generating processes $\\mathcal F_n$, each indexed by the same parameter space $\\Theta$, with $\\theta_0$ a component of the true parameter for each $n$.\nThen estimator $\\hat \\theta$ is\n unbiased if $\\mathbb E [\\hat \\theta] = \\theta_0$ consistent if $\\hat \\theta \\overset{p}{\\to} \\theta_0$ asymptotically normal $\\sqrt{n} (\\hat \\theta - \\theta_0) \\overset{d}{\\to} N(0, V)$ for some positive definite $V$  Test Consistency The asymptotic size of a testing procedure is defined as the limiting probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true. Mathematically, we can write this as $\\lim _ {n \\to \\infty} \\Pr_n ( \\text{reject } H_0 | H_0)$, where the $n$ subscript indexes the sample size.\nA test is said to be consistent against the alternative $H_1$ if the null hypothesis is rejected with probability approaching $1$ when $H_1$ is true: $\\lim _ {N \\to \\infty} \\Pr_N (\\text{reject } H_0 | H_1) \\overset{p}{\\to} 1$.\nConvergence Theorem: Suppose that $\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0) \\overset{d}{\\to} N(0, V)$, where $V$ is positive definite. Then for any non-stochastic $Q\\times P$ matrix $R$, $Q \\leq P$, with rank$( R ) = Q$ $$ \\sqrt{n} R (\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0) \\sim N(0, R VR') $$ and $$ [\\sqrt{n}R(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0)]'[RVR']^{-1}[\\sqrt{n}R(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0)] \\overset{d}{\\to} \\chi^2_Q $$ In addition, if $\\text{plim} \\hat{V} _n = V$, then $$ (\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0)' R'[R (\\hat{V} _n/n) R']^{-1}R (\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0) \\overset{d}{\\to} \\chi^2_Q $$\nWald Statistic For testing the null hypothesis $H_0: R\\theta_0 = r$, where $r$ is a $Q\\times1$ random vector, define the Wald statistic for testing $H_0$ against $H_1 : R\\theta_0 \\neq r$ as $$ W_n = (R\\hat{\\theta} - r)'[R (\\hat{V} _n/n) R']^{-1} (R\\hat{\\theta} - r) $$ Under $H_0$, $W_n \\overset{d}{\\to} \\chi^2_Q$.

The data is freely available at Inside AirBnb: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.\nA description of all variables in all datasets is avaliable here.\nWe are going to use 2 datasets:\n listing dataset: contains listing-level information pricing dataset: contains pricing data, over time  We import and clean them with a script. If you want more details, have a look at the data exploration and data wrangling sections.\ndf_listings, df_prices, df = import_data()  Intro The default library for plotting in python is matplotlib. However, a more modern package that builds on top of it, is seaborn.\nWe start by telling the notebook to display the plots inline.\n%matplotlib inline  Another important configuration is the plot resulution. We set it to retina to have high resolution plots.\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  You can choose set a general theme using plt.style.use(). The list of themes is available here.\nplt.style.use('seaborn')  If you want to further customize some aspects of a theme, you can set some global paramters for all plots. You can find a list of all the options here. If you want to customize all plots in a project in the samy way, you can create a filename.mplstyle file and call it at the beginning of each file as plt.style.use('filename.mplstyle').\nmpl.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10,6) mpl.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 16 mpl.rcParams['axes.titlesize'] = 18 mpl.rcParams['axes.titleweight'] = 'bold' mpl.rcParams['figure.titlesize'] = 18 mpl.rcParams['figure.titleweight'] = 'bold' mpl.rcParams['axes.titlepad'] = 20 mpl.rcParams['legend.facecolor'] = 'w'  Distributions Suppose you have a numerical variable and you want to see how it\u0026rsquo;s distributed. The best option is to use an histogram. Seaborn function is sns.histplot.\ndf_listings['log_price'] = np.log(1+df_listings['mean_price'])  sns.histplot(df_listings['log_price'], bins=50)\\ .set(title='Distribution of log-prices');  We can add a smooth kernel density approximation with the kde option.\nsns.histplot(df_listings['log_price'], bins=50, kde=True)\\ .set(title='Distribution of log-prices with density');  If we have a categorical variable, we might want to plot the distribution of the data across its values. We can use a barplot. Seaborn function is sns.countplot() for count data.\nsns.countplot(x=\u0026quot;neighborhood\u0026quot;, data=df_listings)\\ .set(title='Number of observations by neighborhood');  If instead we want to see the distribution of another variable across some group, we can use the sns.barplot() function.\nsns.barplot(x=\u0026quot;neighborhood\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;mean_price\u0026quot;, data=df_listings)\\ .set(title='Average price by neighborhood');  We can also use other metrics besides the mean with the estimator option.\nsns.barplot(x=\u0026quot;neighborhood\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;mean_price\u0026quot;, data=df_listings, estimator=np.median)\\ .set(title='Median price by neighborhood');  We can also plot the full distribution using, for example boxplots with sns.boxplot(). Boxplots display quartiles and outliers.\nsns.boxplot(x=\u0026quot;neighborhood\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;, data=df_listings)\\ .set(title='Price distribution across neighborhoods');  If we want to see the full distribution, we can use the sns.violinplot() function.\nsns.violinplot(x=\u0026quot;neighborhood\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;, data=df_listings)\\ .set(title='Price distribution across neighborhoods');  Time Series If the dataset has a time dimension, we might want to explore how a variable evolves over time. Seaborn function is sns.lineplot(). If the data has multiple observations for each time period, it will also display a 95% confidence interval around the mean.\nsns.lineplot(data=df, x='date', y='price')\\ .set(title=\u0026quot;Price distribution over time\u0026quot;);  We can do the samy by group, with the hue option. We can suppress confidence intervals setting ci=None (making the code much faster).\nsns.lineplot(data=df, x='date', y='price', hue='neighborhood', ci=None)\\ .set(title=\u0026quot;Price distribution over time\u0026quot;);  Correlations df_listings[\u0026quot;log_reviews\u0026quot;] = np.log(1 + df_listings[\u0026quot;number_of_reviews\u0026quot;]) df_listings[\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;] = np.log(1 + df_listings[\u0026quot;reviews_per_month\u0026quot;])  The most intuitive way to plot a correlation between two variables is a scatterplot. Seaborn function is sns.scatterplot()\nsns.scatterplot(data=df_listings, x=\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;, alpha=0.3)\\ .set(title='Prices and Reviews');  We can highlight the best linear approximation adding a line of fit using sns.regplot().\nsns.regplot(x=\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;, data=df_listings, scatter_kws={'alpha':.1}, line_kws={'color':'C1'})\\ .set(title='Price and Reviews');  If we want a more flexible representation of the data, we can use the binscatter package. binscatter splits the data into equally sized bins and displays a scatterplot of the averages.\nThe main difference between a binscatterplot and an histogram is that in a histogram bins have the same width while in a binscatterplot bins have the same number of observations.\nAn advantage of binscatter is that it makes the nature of the data much more transparent, at the cost of hiding some of the background noise.\nimport binscatter # Remove nans temp = df_listings[[\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;]].dropna() # Binned scatter plot of Wage vs Tenure fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.binscatter(temp[\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;], temp[\u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;]); ax.set_title('Price and Reviews');  As usual, we can split the data by group with the hue option.\nsns.scatterplot(data=df_listings, x=\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;, hue=\u0026quot;room_type\u0026quot;, alpha=0.3)\\ .set(title=\u0026quot;Prices and Ratings, by room type\u0026quot;);  We can also add the marginal distributions using the sns.jointplot() function.\nsns.jointplot(data=df_listings, x=\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;, kind=\u0026quot;hex\u0026quot;)\\ .fig.suptitle(\u0026quot;Prices and Reviews, with marginals\u0026quot;) plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9);  If we want to plot correlations (and marginals) of multiple variables, we can use the sns.pairplot() function.\nsns.pairplot(data=df_listings, vars=[\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;log_reviews\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;], plot_kws={'s':2})\\ .fig.suptitle(\u0026quot;Correlations\u0026quot;); plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)  We can distinguish across groups with the hue option.\nsns.pairplot(data=df_listings, vars=[\u0026quot;log_rpm\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;log_reviews\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;log_price\u0026quot;], hue='room_type', plot_kws={'s':2})\\ .fig.suptitle(\u0026quot;Correlations, by room type\u0026quot;); plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)  If we want to plot all the correlations in the data, we can use the sns.heatmap() function on top of a correlation matrix generated by .corr().\n# Plot sns.heatmap(df.corr(), vmin=-1, vmax=1, linewidths=.5, cmap=\u0026quot;RdBu\u0026quot;)\\ .set(title=\u0026quot;Correlations\u0026quot;);  Geographical data We can in principle plot geographical data as a simple scatterplot.\nsns.scatterplot(data=df_listings, x=\u0026quot;longitude\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;latitude\u0026quot;)\\ .set(title='Listing coordinates');  However, we can do better and do the scatterplot over a map layer.\nFirst, we neeed to convert the latitude and longitude variables into coordinates. We use the library geopandas. Note that the original coordinate system is 4326 (3D) and we need to 3857 (2D).\ngeom = geopandas.points_from_xy(df_listings.longitude, df_listings.latitude) gdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame( df_listings, geometry=geom, crs=4326).to_crs(3857)  We import a map of Bologna using the library contextily.\nbologna = contextily.Place(\u0026quot;Bologna\u0026quot;, source=contextily.providers.Stamen.TonerLite)  We are now ready to plot it with the airbnb listings.\nax = bologna.plot() ax.set_ylim([5530000, 5555000]) gdf.plot(ax=ax, c=df_listings['mean_price'], cmap='viridis', alpha=0.8);  ","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"bb056caedc679d8e403fac05680718fb","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/data-science/05_plotting/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/data-science/05_plotting/","section":"course","summary":"import numpy as np import pandas as pd import folium import geopandas import contextily import matplotlib as mpl import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns from src.import_data import import_data  For the scope of this tutorial we are going to use AirBnb Scraped data for the city of Bologna.","tags":null,"title":"Plotting","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"# Remove warnings import warnings warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')  # Import import pandas as pd import numpy as np import time import itertools import statsmodels.api as sm import seaborn as sns from numpy.random import normal, uniform from itertools import combinations from statsmodels.api import add_constant from statsmodels.regression.linear_model import OLS from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, RidgeCV, LassoCV from sklearn.cross_decomposition import PLSRegression, PLSSVD from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score, train_test_split, LeaveOneOut, ShuffleSplit from sklearn.preprocessing import scale from sklearn.decomposition import PCA from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error  # Import matplotlib for graphs import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d # Set global parameters %matplotlib inline plt.style.use('seaborn-white') plt.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 3 plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12,5) plt.rcParams['figure.titlesize'] = 20 plt.rcParams['axes.titlesize'] = 18 plt.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 14 plt.rcParams['legend.fontsize'] = 14  When we talk about big data, we do not only talk about bigger sample size, $n$, but also about a larger number of explanatory variables, $p$. However, with ordinary least squares, we are limited by the identification constraint that $p \u0026lt; n$. Moreover, for inference and prediction accuracy, we would actually like to have $k \u0026laquo; n$.\nThis session adresses methods to use a least squares fit in a setting in which the number of regressors, $p$, is large with respect to the sample size, $n$\n5.1 Subset Selection The Subset Selection approach involves identifying a subset of the $p$ predictors that we believe to be related to the response. We then fit a model using least squares on the reduced set of variables.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s load the credit rating dataset.\n# Credit ratings dataset credit = pd.read_csv('data/Credit.csv', usecols=list(range(1,12))) credit.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Income Limit Rating Cards Age Education Gender Student Married Ethnicity Balance     0 14.891 3606 283 2 34 11 Male No Yes Caucasian 333   1 106.025 6645 483 3 82 15 Female Yes Yes Asian 903   2 104.593 7075 514 4 71 11 Male No No Asian 580   3 148.924 9504 681 3 36 11 Female No No Asian 964   4 55.882 4897 357 2 68 16 Male No Yes Caucasian 331     We are going to look at the relationship between individual characteristics and account Balance in the Credit dataset.\n# X and y X = credit.loc[:, credit.columns != 'Balance'] y = credit.loc[:,'Balance']  Best Subset Selection To perform best subset selection, we fit a separate least squares regression for each possible combination of the $p$ predictors. That is, we fit all $p$ models that contain exactly one predictor, all $p = p(p−1)/2$ models that contain 2 exactly two predictors, and so forth. We then look at all of the resulting models, with the goal of identifying the one that is best.\nClearly the main disadvantage of best subset selection is computational power.\ndef model_selection(X, y, *args): # Init scores = list(itertools.repeat(np.zeros((0,2)), len(args))) # Categorical variables categ_cols = {\u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Student\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Married\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ethnicity\u0026quot;} # Loop over all admissible number of regressors K = np.shape(X)[1] for k in range(K+1): print(\u0026quot;Computing k=%1.0f\u0026quot; % k, end =\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # Loop over all combinations for i in combinations(range(K), k): # Subset X X_subset = X.iloc[:,list(i)] # Get dummies for categorical variables if k\u0026gt;0: categ_subset = list(categ_cols \u0026amp; set(X_subset.columns)) X_subset = pd.get_dummies(X_subset, columns=categ_subset, drop_first=True) # Regress reg = OLS(y,add_constant(X_subset)).fit() # Metrics for i,metric in enumerate(args): score = np.reshape([k,metric(reg)], (1,-1)) scores[i] = np.append(scores[i], score, axis=0) print(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, end=\u0026quot;\\r\u0026quot;) return scores  We are going to consider 10 variables and two difference metrics: the Sum of Squares Residuals and $R^2$.\n# Set metrics rss = lambda reg : reg.ssr r2 = lambda reg : reg.rsquared # Compute scores scores = model_selection(X, y, rss, r2) ms_RSS = scores[0] ms_R2 = scores[1]  Computing k=10  # Save best scores K = np.shape(X)[1] ms_RSS_best = [np.min(ms_RSS[ms_RSS[:,0]==k,1]) for k in range(K+1)] ms_R2_best = [np.max(ms_R2[ms_R2[:,0]==k,1]) for k in range(K+1)]  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the best scores.\n# Figure 6.1 def make_figure_6_1(): fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.1: Best Model Selection') # RSS ax1.scatter(x=ms_RSS[:,0], y=ms_RSS[:,1], facecolors='None', edgecolors='k', alpha=0.5); ax1.plot(range(K+1), ms_RSS_best, c='r'); ax1.scatter(np.argmin(ms_RSS_best), np.min(ms_RSS_best), marker='x', s=300) ax1.set_ylabel('RSS'); # R2 ax2.scatter(x=ms_R2[:,0], y=ms_R2[:,1], facecolors='None', edgecolors='k', alpha=0.5); ax2.plot(range(K+1), ms_R2_best, c='r'); ax2.scatter(np.argmax(ms_R2_best), np.max(ms_R2_best), marker='x', s=300) ax2.set_ylabel('R2'); # All axes; for ax in fig.axes: ax.set_xlabel('Number of Predictors'); ax.set_yticks([]);  make_figure_6_1()  The figure shows that, as expected, both metrics improve as the number of variables increases; however, from the three-variable model on, there is little improvement in RSS and $R^2$ as a result of including additional predictors.\nForward Stepwise Selection For computational reasons, best subset selection cannot be applied with very large $p$.\nWhile the best subset selection procedure considers all $2^p$ possible models containing subsets of the p predictors, forward step-wise considers a much smaller set of models. Forward stepwise selection begins with a model containing no predictors, and then adds predictors to the model, one-at-a-time, until all of the predictors are in the model. In particular, at each step the variable that gives the greatest additional improvement to the fit is added to the model.\ndef forward_selection(X, y, f): # Init RSS and R2 K = np.shape(X)[1] fms_scores = np.zeros((K,1)) # Categorical variables categ_cols = {\u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Student\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Married\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ethnicity\u0026quot;} # Loop over p selected_cols = [] for k in range(1,K+1): # Loop over selected columns remaining_cols = [col for col in X.columns if col not in selected_cols] temp_scores = np.zeros((0,1)) # Loop on remaining columns for col in remaining_cols: # Subset X X_subset = X.loc[:,selected_cols + [col]] if k\u0026gt;0: categ_subset = list(categ_cols \u0026amp; set(X_subset.columns)) X_subset = pd.get_dummies(X_subset, columns=categ_subset, drop_first=True) # Regress reg = OLS(y,add_constant(X_subset).values).fit() # Metrics temp_scores = np.append(temp_scores, f(reg)) # Pick best variable best_col = remaining_cols[np.argmin(temp_scores)] print(best_col) selected_cols += [best_col] fms_scores[k-1] = np.min(temp_scores) return fms_scores  Let\u0026rsquo;s select the best model according, using the sum of squared residuals as a metric.\nWhat are the most important variables?\n# Forward selection by RSS rss = lambda reg : reg.ssr fms_RSS = forward_selection(X, y, rss)  Rating Income Student Limit Cards Age Ethnicity Gender Married Education  What happens if we use $R^2$ instead?\n# Forward selection by R2 r2 = lambda reg : -reg.rsquared fms_R2 = -forward_selection(X, y, r2)  Rating Income Student Limit Cards Age Ethnicity Gender Married Education  Unsurprisingly, both methods select the same models. Why? In the end $R^2$ is just a normalized version of RSS.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s plot the scores of the two methods, for different number of predictors.\n# New figure 1 def make_new_figure_1(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2) fig.suptitle('Forward Model Selection') # RSS ax1.plot(range(1,K+1), fms_RSS, c='r'); ax1.scatter(np.argmin(fms_RSS)+1, np.min(fms_RSS), marker='x', s=300) ax1.set_ylabel('RSS'); # R2 ax2.plot(range(1,K+1), fms_R2, c='r'); ax2.scatter(np.argmax(fms_R2)+1, np.max(fms_R2), marker='x', s=300) ax2.set_ylabel('R2'); # All axes; for ax in fig.axes: ax.set_xlabel('Number of Predictors'); ax.set_yticks([]);  make_new_figure_1()  Backward Stepwise Selection Like forward stepwise selection, backward stepwise selection provides an efficient alternative to best subset selection. However, unlike forward stepwise selection, it begins with the full least squares model containing all p predictors, and then iteratively removes the least useful predictor, one-at-a-time.\ndef backward_selection(X, y, f): # Init RSS and R2 K = np.shape(X)[1] fms_scores = np.zeros((K,1)) # Categorical variables categ_cols = {\u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Student\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Married\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ethnicity\u0026quot;} # Loop over p selected_cols = list(X.columns) for k in range(K,0,-1): # Loop over selected columns temp_scores = np.zeros((0,1)) # Loop on remaining columns for col in selected_cols: # Subset X X_subset = X.loc[:,[x for x in selected_cols if x != col]] if k\u0026gt;1: categ_subset = list(categ_cols \u0026amp; set(X_subset.columns)) X_subset = pd.get_dummies(X_subset, columns=categ_subset, drop_first=True) # Regress reg = OLS(y,add_constant(X_subset).values).fit() # Metrics temp_scores = np.append(temp_scores, f(reg)) # Pick best variable worst_col = selected_cols[np.argmin(temp_scores)] print(worst_col) selected_cols.remove(worst_col) fms_scores[k-1] = np.min(temp_scores) return fms_scores  Let\u0026rsquo;s select the best model according, using the sum of squared residuals as a metric.\nWhat are the most important variables?\n# Backward selection by RSS rss = lambda reg : reg.ssr bms_RSS = backward_selection(X, y, rss)  Education Married Gender Ethnicity Age Rating Cards Student Income Limit  What if we use $R^2$ instead?\n# Backward selection by R2 r2 = lambda reg : -reg.rsquared bms_R2 = -backward_selection(X, y, r2)  Education Married Gender Ethnicity Age Rating Cards Student Income Limit  The interesting part here is that the the variable Rating that was selected first by forward model selection, is now dropped $5^{th}$ to last. Why? It\u0026rsquo;s probably because it contains a lot of information by itself (hence first in FMS) but it\u0026rsquo;s highly correlated with Student, Income and Limit while these variables are more ortogonal to each other, and hence it gets dropped before them in BMS.\n# Plot correlations sns.pairplot(credit[['Rating','Student','Income','Limit']], height=1.8);  If is indeed what we see: Rating and Limit are highly correlated.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s plot the scores for different number of predictors.\n# New figure 2 def make_new_figure_2(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2) fig.suptitle('Backward Model Selection') # RSS ax1.plot(range(1,K+1), bms_RSS, c='r'); ax1.scatter(np.argmin(bms_RSS)+1, np.min(bms_RSS), marker='x', s=300) ax1.set_ylabel('RSS'); # R2 ax2.plot(range(1,K+1), bms_R2, c='r'); ax2.scatter(np.argmax(bms_R2)+1, np.max(bms_R2), marker='x', s=300) ax2.set_ylabel('R2'); # All axes; for ax in fig.axes: ax.set_xlabel('Number of Predictors'); ax.set_yticks([]);  make_new_figure_2()  Choosing the Optimal Model So far we have use the trainint error in order to select the model. However, the training error can be a poor estimate of the test error. Therefore, RSS and R2 are not suitable for selecting the best model among a collection of models with different numbers of predictors.\nIn order to select the best model with respect to test error, we need to estimate this test error. There are two common approaches:\n We can indirectly estimate test error by making an adjustment to the training error to account for the bias due to overfitting. We can directly estimate the test error, using either a validation set approach or a cross-validation approach.  Some metrics that account for the trainint error are\n Akaike Information Criterium (AIC) Bayesian Information Criterium (BIC) Adjusted $R^2$  The idea behind all these varaibles is to insert a penalty for the number of parameters used in the model. All these measure have theoretical fundations which are beyond the scope of this session.\nWe are now going to test the three metrics\n# Set metrics aic = lambda reg : reg.aic bic = lambda reg : reg.bic r2a = lambda reg : reg.rsquared_adj # Compute best model selection scores scores = model_selection(X, y, aic, bic, r2a) ms_AIC = scores[0] ms_BIC = scores[1] ms_R2a = scores[2]  Computing k=10  # Save best scores ms_AIC_best = [np.min(ms_AIC[ms_AIC[:,0]==k,1]) for k in range(K+1)] ms_BIC_best = [np.min(ms_BIC[ms_BIC[:,0]==k,1]) for k in range(K+1)] ms_R2a_best = [np.max(ms_R2a[ms_R2a[:,0]==k,1]) for k in range(K+1)]  We plot the scores for different model selection methods.\n# Figure 6.2 def make_figure_6_2(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2,ax3) = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(16,5)) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.2') # AIC ax1.scatter(x=ms_AIC[:,0], y=ms_AIC[:,1], facecolors='None', edgecolors='k', alpha=0.5); ax1.plot(range(K+1),ms_AIC_best, c='r'); ax1.scatter(np.argmin(ms_AIC_best), np.min(ms_AIC_best), marker='x', s=300) ax1.set_ylabel('AIC'); # BIC ax2.scatter(x=ms_BIC[:,0], y=ms_BIC[:,1], facecolors='None', edgecolors='k', alpha=0.5); ax2.plot(range(K+1), ms_BIC_best, c='r'); ax2.scatter(np.argmin(ms_BIC_best), np.min(ms_BIC_best), marker='x', s=300) ax2.set_ylabel('BIC'); # R2 adj ax3.scatter(x=ms_R2a[:,0], y=ms_R2a[:,1], facecolors='None', edgecolors='k', alpha=0.5); ax3.plot(range(K+1), ms_R2a_best, c='r'); ax3.scatter(np.argmax(ms_R2a_best), np.max(ms_R2a_best), marker='x', s=300) ax3.set_ylabel('R2_adj'); # All axes; for ax in fig.axes: ax.set_xlabel('Number of Predictors'); ax.set_yticks([]);  make_figure_6_2()  As we can see, all three metrics select more parsimonious models, with BIC being particularly conservative with only 4 variables and $R^2_{adj}$ selecting the larger model with 7 variables.\nValidation and Cross-Validation As an alternative to the approaches just discussed, we can directly estimate the test error using the validation set and cross-validation methods discussed in the previous session.\nThe main problem with cross-validation is the computational burden. We are now going to perform best model selection using the following cross-validation algorithms:\n Validation set approach, 50-50 split, repeated 10 times 5-fold cross-validation 10-fold cross-validation  We are not going to perform Leave-One-Out cross-validation for computational reasons.\ndef cv_scores(X, y, *args): # Init scores = list(itertools.repeat(np.zeros((0,2)), len(args))) # Categorical variables categ_cols = {\u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Student\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Married\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ethnicity\u0026quot;} # Loop over all possible combinations of regressions K = np.shape(X)[1] for k in range(K+1): print(\u0026quot;Computing k=%1.0f\u0026quot; % k, end =\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) for i in combinations(range(K), k): # Subset X X_subset = X.iloc[:,list(i)] # Get dummies for categorical variables if k\u0026gt;0: categ_subset = list(categ_cols \u0026amp; set(X_subset.columns)) X_subset = pd.get_dummies(X_subset, columns=categ_subset, drop_first=True) # Metrics for i,cv_method in enumerate(args): score = cross_val_score(LinearRegression(), add_constant(X_subset), y, cv=cv_method, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error').mean() score_pair = np.reshape([k,score], (1,-1)) scores[i] = np.append(scores[i], score_pair, axis=0) print(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, end=\u0026quot;\\r\u0026quot;) return scores  Let\u0026rsquo;s compute the scores for different model selection methods.\n# Define cv methods vset = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=10, test_size=0.5) kf5 = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True) kf10 = KFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True) # Get best model selection scores scores = cv_scores(X, y, vset, kf5, kf10) ms_vset = scores[0] ms_kf5 = scores[1] ms_kf10 = scores[2]  Computing k=10  # Save best scores ms_vset_best = [np.max(ms_vset[ms_vset[:,0]==k,1]) for k in range(K+1)] ms_kf5_best = [np.max(ms_kf5[ms_kf5[:,0]==k,1]) for k in range(K+1)] ms_kf10_best = [np.max(ms_kf10[ms_kf10[:,0]==k,1]) for k in range(K+1)]  We not plot the scores.\n# Figure 6.3 def make_figure_6_3(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2,ax3) = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(16,5)) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.3') # Validation Set ax1.scatter(x=ms_vset[:,0], y=ms_vset[:,1], facecolors='None', edgecolors='k', alpha=0.5); ax1.plot(range(K+1),ms_vset_best, c='r'); ax1.scatter(np.argmax(ms_vset_best), np.max(ms_vset_best), marker='x', s=300) ax1.set_ylabel('Validation Set'); # 5-Fold Cross Validation ax2.scatter(x=ms_kf5[:,0], y=ms_kf5[:,1], facecolors='None', edgecolors='k', alpha=0.5); ax2.plot(range(K+1), ms_kf5_best, c='r'); ax2.scatter(np.argmax(ms_kf5_best), np.max(ms_kf5_best), marker='x', s=300) ax2.set_ylabel('5-Fold Cross Validation'); # 10-Fold Cross-Validation ax3.scatter(x=ms_kf10[:,0], y=ms_kf10[:,1], facecolors='None', edgecolors='k', alpha=0.5); ax3.plot(range(K+1), ms_kf10_best, c='r'); ax3.scatter(np.argmax(ms_kf10_best), np.max(ms_kf10_best), marker='x', s=300) ax3.set_ylabel('10-Fold Cross-Validation'); # All axes; for ax in fig.axes: ax.set_xlabel('Number of Predictors'); ax.set_yticks([]);  make_figure_6_3()  From the figure we see that each cross-validation method selects a different model and the most accurate one, K-fold CV, select 5 predictors.\n5.2 Shrinkage Methods Model selection methods constrained the number of varaibles before running a linear regression. Shrinkage methods attempt to do the two things simultaneously. In particular they constrain or shrink coefficients by imposing penalties in the objective functions for high values of the parameters.\nRidge Regression The Least Squares Regression minimizes the Residual Sum of Squares\n$$ \\mathrm{RSS}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j} x_{i j}\\right)^{2} $$\nThe Ridge Regression objective function instead is\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j} x_{i j}\\right)^{2}+\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j}^{2}=\\mathrm{RSS}+\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j}^{2} $$\nwhere $\\lambda\u0026gt;0$ is a tuning parameter that regulates the extent to which large parameters are penalized.\nIn matrix notation, the objective function is\n$$ ||X\\beta - y||^2_2 + \\alpha ||\\beta||^2_2 $$\nwhich is equivalent to optimizing\n$$ \\frac{1}{N}||X\\beta - y||^2_2 + \\frac{\\alpha}{N} ||\\beta||^2_2 $$\nWe are now going to run Ridge Regression on the Credit dataset trying to explain account Balance with a set of observable individual characteristics.\n# X and y categ_cols = [\u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Student\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Married\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ethnicity\u0026quot;] X = credit.loc[:, credit.columns != 'Balance'] X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=categ_cols, drop_first=True) y = credit.loc[:,'Balance'] n = len(credit)  We run ridge regression over a range of values for the penalty paramenter $\\lambda$.\n# Init alpha grid n_grid = 100 alphas = 10**np.linspace(-2,5,n_grid).reshape(-1,1) ridge = Ridge() ridge_coefs = [] # Loop over values of alpha for a in alphas: ridge.set_params(alpha=a) ridge.fit(scale(X), y) ridge_coefs.append(ridge.coef_) ridge_coefs = np.reshape(ridge_coefs,(n_grid,-1))  We use linear regression as a comparison.\n# OLS regression ols = LinearRegression().fit(scale(X),y) ols_coefs = ols.coef_; mod_ols = np.linalg.norm(ols_coefs) # Relative magnitude rel_beta = [np.linalg.norm(ridge_coefs[k,:])/mod_ols for k in range(n_grid)] rel_beta = np.reshape(rel_beta, (-1,1))  We plot the results\n# Figure 6.4 def make_figure_6_4(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.4: Ridge Regression Coefficients') highlight = [0,1,2,7]; # Plot coefficients - absolute ax1.plot(alphas, ridge_coefs[:,highlight], alpha=1) ax1.plot(alphas, ridge_coefs, c='grey', alpha=0.3) ax1.set_xscale('log') ax1.set_xlabel('lambda'); ax1.set_ylabel('Standardized coefficients'); ax1.legend(['Income', 'Limit', 'Rating', 'Student']) # Plot coefficients - relative ax2.plot(rel_beta, ridge_coefs[:,highlight], alpha=1) ax2.plot(rel_beta, ridge_coefs, c='grey', alpha=0.3) ax2.set_xlabel('Relative Beta'); ax2.set_ylabel('Standardized coefficients');  make_figure_6_4()  As we decrease $\\lambda$, the Ridge coefficients get larger. Moreover, the variables with the consistently largest coefficients are Income, Limit, Rating and Student.\nBias-Variance Trade-off Ridge regression’s advantage over least squares is rooted in the bias-variance trade-off. As $\\lambda$ increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases, leading to decreased variance but increased bias.\n$$ y_0 = f(x_0) + \\varepsilon $$\nRecap: we can decompose the Mean Squared Error of an estimator into two components: the variance and the squared bias:\n$$ \\mathbb E\\left(y_{0}-\\hat{f}\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right)^{2} = \\mathbb E\\left(f(x_0) + \\varepsilon - \\hat f(x_{0})\\right)^{2} = \\ = \\mathbb E\\left(f(x_0) - \\mathbb E[\\hat f(x_{0})] + \\varepsilon - \\hat f(x_{0}) + \\mathbb E[\\hat f(x_{0})] \\right)^{2} = \\ = \\mathbb E \\left[ \\mathbb E [\\hat{f} (x_{0}) ] - f(x_0) \\right]^2 + \\mathbb E \\left[ \\left( \\hat{f} (x_{0}) - \\mathbb E [\\hat{f} (x_{0})] \\right)^2 \\right] + \\mathbb E[\\varepsilon^2] \\ = \\operatorname{Bias} \\left( \\hat{f} (x_{0}) \\right)^2 + \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\hat{f}\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\right) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon) $$\nThe last term is the variance of the error term, sometimes also called the irreducible error since it\u0026rsquo;s pure noise, and we cannot account for it.\n# Compute var-bias def compute_var_bias(X_train, b0, x0, a, k, n, sim, f): # Init y_hat = np.zeros(sim) coefs = np.zeros((sim, k)) # Loop over simulations for s in range(sim): e_train = normal(0,1,(n,1)) y_train = X_train @ b0 + e_train fit = f(a).fit(X_train, y_train) y_hat[s] = fit.predict(x0) coefs[s,:] = fit.coef_ # Compute MSE, Var and Bias2 e_test = normal(0,1,(sim,1)) y_test = x0 @ b0 + e_test mse = np.mean((y_test - y_hat)**2) var = np.var(y_hat) bias2 = np.mean(x0 @ b0 - y_hat)**2 return [mse, var, bias2], np.mean(coefs, axis=0)  np.random.seed(1) # Generate random data n = 50 k = 45 N = 50000 X_train = normal(0.2,1,(n,k)) x0 = normal(0.2,1,(1,k)) e_train = normal(0,1,(n,1)) b0 = uniform(0,1,(k,1))  # Init alpha grid sim = 1000 n_grid = 30 df = pd.DataFrame({'alpha':10**np.linspace(-5,5,n_grid)}) ridge_coefs2 = [] # Init simulations sim = 1000 ridge = lambda a: Ridge(alpha=a, fit_intercept=False) # Loop over values of alpha for i in range(len(df)): print(\u0026quot;Alpha %1.0f/%1.0f\u0026quot; % (i+1,len(df)), end =\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) a = df.loc[i,'alpha'] df.loc[i,['mse','var','bias2']], c = compute_var_bias(X_train, b0, x0, a, k, n, sim, ridge) ridge_coefs2.append(c) print(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, end=\u0026quot;\\r\u0026quot;) ridge_coefs2 = np.reshape(ridge_coefs2,(n_grid,-1))  Alpha 30/30  # OLS regression y_train = X_train @ b0 + e_train ols = LinearRegression().fit(X_train,y_train) ols_coefs = ols.coef_; mod_ols = np.linalg.norm(ols_coefs) # Relative magnitude rel_beta = [np.linalg.norm(ridge_coefs2[i,:])/mod_ols for i in range(n_grid)] rel_beta = np.reshape(rel_beta, (-1,1))  # Figure 6.5 def make_figure_6_5(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.5: Ridge Bias-Var decomposition') # MSE ax1.plot(df['alpha'], df[['bias2','var','mse']]); ax1.set_xscale('log'); ax1.set_xlabel('lambda'); ax1.set_ylabel('Mean Squared Error'); ax1.legend(['Bias2','Variance','MSE'], fontsize=12); # MSE ax2.plot(rel_beta, df[['bias2','var','mse']]); ax2.set_xlabel('Relative Beta'); ax2.set_ylabel('Mean Squared Error'); ax2.legend(['Bias2','Variance','MSE'], fontsize=12);  make_figure_6_5()  Ridge regression has the advantage of shrinking coefficients. However, unlike best subset, forward stepwise, and backward stepwise selection, which will generally select models that involve just a subset of the variables, ridge regression will include all $p$ predictors in the final model.\nLasso solves that problem by using a different penalty function.\nLasso The lasso coefficients minimize the following objective function:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j} x_{i j}\\right)^{2}+\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\left|\\beta_{j}\\right| = \\mathrm{RSS} + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p|\\beta_j| $$\nso that the main difference with respect to ridge regression is the penalty function $\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\left|\\beta_{j}\\right|$ instead of $\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p (\\beta_j)^2$.\nA consequence of this objective function is that Lasso is much more likely to shrink coefficients to exactly zero, while Ridge only decreases their magnitude. The reason why lies in the shape of the objective function. You can rewrite the Ridge and Lasso minimization problems as constrained optimization:\n  Ridge $$ \\underset{\\beta}{\\operatorname{min}} \\ \\left{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j} x_{i j}\\right)^{2}\\right} \\quad \\text { subject to } \\quad \\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\left|\\beta_{j}\\right| \\leq s $$\n  Lasso $$ \\underset{\\beta}{\\operatorname{min}} \\ \\left{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j} x_{i j}\\right)^{2}\\right} \\quad \\text { subject to } \\quad \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j}^{2} \\leq s $$\n  In pictures, constrained optimization problem lookes like this.\nThe red curves represents the contour sets of the RSS. They are elliptical since the objective function is quadratic. The blue area represents the admissible set, i.e. the constraints. As we can see, it is much easier with Lasso to have the constrained optimum on one of the edges of the rhombus.\nWe are now going to repeat the same exercise on the Credit dataset, trying to predict account Balance with a set of obsevable induvidual characteristics, for different values of the penalty paramenter $\\lambda$.\n# X and y categ_cols = [\u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Student\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Married\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ethnicity\u0026quot;] X = credit.loc[:, credit.columns != 'Balance'] X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=categ_cols, drop_first=True) y = credit.loc[:,'Balance']  The $\\lambda$ grid is going to be slightly different now.\n# Init alpha grid n_grid = 100 alphas = 10**np.linspace(0,3,n_grid).reshape(-1,1) lasso = Lasso() lasso_coefs = [] # Loop over values of alpha for a in alphas: lasso.set_params(alpha=a) lasso.fit(scale(X), y) lasso_coefs.append(lasso.coef_) lasso_coefs = np.reshape(lasso_coefs,(n_grid,-1))  We run OLS to plot the relative magnitude of the Lasso coefficients.\n# Relative magnitude mod_ols = np.linalg.norm(ols_coefs) rel_beta = [np.linalg.norm(lasso_coefs[i,:])/mod_ols for i in range(n_grid)] rel_beta = np.reshape(rel_beta, (-1,1))  We plot the magnitude of the coefficients $\\beta$\n for different values of $\\lambda$ for different values of of $||\\beta||$  # Figure 6.6 def make_figure_6_6(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.6') highlight = [0,1,2,7]; # Plot coefficients - absolute ax1.plot(alphas, lasso_coefs[:,highlight], alpha=1) ax1.plot(alphas, lasso_coefs, c='grey', alpha=0.3) ax1.set_xscale('log') ax1.set_xlabel('lambda'); ax1.set_ylabel('Standardized coefficients'); ax1.legend(['Income', 'Limit', 'Rating', 'Student'], fontsize=12) # Plot coefficients - relative ax2.plot(rel_beta, lasso_coefs[:,highlight], alpha=1) ax2.plot(rel_beta, lasso_coefs, c='grey', alpha=0.3) ax2.set_xlabel('relative mod beta'); ax2.set_ylabel('Standardized coefficients');  make_figure_6_6()  Rating seems to be the most important variable, followed by Limit and Student.\nAs with ridge regression, the lasso shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. However, in the case of the lasso, the $l_1$ penalty has the effect of forcing some of the coefficient estimates to be exactly equal to zero when the tuning parameter $\\lambda$ is sufficiently large. Hence, much like best subset selection, the lasso performs variable selection.\nWe say that the lasso yields sparse models — that is, models that involve only a subset of the variable\nWe now plot how the choice of $\\lambda$ affects the bias-variance trade-off.\n# Init alpha grid sim = 1000 n_grid = 30 df = pd.DataFrame({'alpha':10**np.linspace(-1,1,n_grid)}) lasso_coefs2 = [] # Init simulations sim = 1000 lasso = lambda a: Lasso(alpha=a, fit_intercept=False) # Loop over values of alpha for i in range(len(df)): print(\u0026quot;Alpha %1.0f/%1.0f\u0026quot; % (i+1,len(df)), end =\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) a = df.loc[i,'alpha'] df.loc[i,['mse','var','bias2']], c = compute_var_bias(X_train, b0, x0, a, k, n, sim, lasso) lasso_coefs2.append(c) print(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, end=\u0026quot;\\r\u0026quot;) lasso_coefs2 = np.reshape(lasso_coefs2,(n_grid,-1))  Alpha 30/30  # Relative magnitude mod_ols = np.linalg.norm(ols_coefs) rel_beta = [np.linalg.norm(lasso_coefs2[k,:])/mod_ols for k in range(n_grid)] rel_beta = np.reshape(rel_beta, (-1,1))  # OLS regression y_train = X_train @ b0 + e_train ols = LinearRegression().fit(X_train,y_train) ols_coefs = ols.coef_; mod_ols = np.linalg.norm(ols_coefs) # Relative magnitude mod_ols = np.linalg.norm(ols_coefs) rel_beta = [np.linalg.norm(lasso_coefs2[k,:])/mod_ols for k in range(n_grid)] rel_beta = np.reshape(rel_beta, (-1,1))  # Figure 6.8 def make_figure_6_8(): fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(12,5)) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.8: Lasso Bias-Var decomposition') # MSE ax1.plot(df['alpha'], df[['bias2','var','mse']]); ax1.set_xscale('log'); ax1.set_xlabel('lambda'); ax1.set_ylabel('Mean Squared Error'); ax1.legend(['Bias2','Variance','MSE'], fontsize=12); # MSE ax2.plot(rel_beta, df[['bias2','var','mse']]); ax2.set_xlabel('Relative Beta'); ax1.set_ylabel('Mean Squared Error'); ax2.legend(['Bias2','Variance','MSE'], fontsize=12);  make_figure_6_8()  As $\\lambda$ increases the squared bias increases and the variance decreases.\nComparing the Lasso and Ridge Regression In order to obtain a better intuition about the behavior of ridge regression and the lasso, consider a simple special case with $n = p$, and $X$ a diagonal matrix with $1$’s on the diagonal and $0$’s in all off-diagonal elements. To simplify the problem further, assume also that we are performing regression without an intercept.\nWith these assumptions, the usual least squares problem simplifies to the coefficients that minimize\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\left(y_{j}-\\beta_{j}\\right)^{2} $$\nIn this case, the least squares solution is given by\n$$ \\hat \\beta_j = y_j $$\nOne can show that in this setting, the ridge regression estimates take the form\n$$ \\hat \\beta_j^{RIDGE} = \\frac{y_j}{1+\\lambda} $$\nand the lasso estimates take the form\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}{j}^{LASSO}=\\left{\\begin{array}{ll} y{j}-\\lambda / 2 \u0026amp; \\text { if } y_{j}\u0026gt;\\lambda / 2 \\ y_{j}+\\lambda / 2 \u0026amp; \\text { if } y_{j}\u0026lt;-\\lambda / 2 \\ 0 \u0026amp; \\text { if }\\left|y_{j}\\right| \\leq \\lambda / 2 \\end{array}\\right. $$\nWe plot the relationship visually.\nnp.random.seed(3) # Generate random data n = 100 k = n X = np.eye(k) e = normal(0,1,(n,1)) b0 = uniform(-1,1,(k,1)) y = X @ b0 + e  # OLS regression reg = LinearRegression().fit(X,y) ols_coefs = reg.coef_; # Ridge regression ridge = Ridge(alpha=1).fit(X,y) ridge_coefs = ridge.coef_; # Ridge regression lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.01).fit(X,y) lasso_coefs = lasso.coef_.reshape(1,-1); # sort order = np.argsort(y.reshape(1,-1), axis=1) y_sorted = np.take_along_axis(ols_coefs, order, axis=1) ols_coefs = np.take_along_axis(ols_coefs, order, axis=1) ridge_coefs = np.take_along_axis(ridge_coefs, order, axis=1) lasso_coefs = np.take_along_axis(lasso_coefs, order, axis=1)  # Figure 6.10 def make_figure_6_10(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.10') # Ridge ax1.plot(y_sorted.T, ols_coefs.T) ax1.plot(y_sorted.T, ridge_coefs.T) ax1.set_xlabel('True Coefficient'); ax1.set_ylabel('Estimated Coefficient'); ax1.legend(['OLS','Ridge'], fontsize=12); # Lasso ax2.plot(y_sorted.T, ols_coefs.T) ax2.plot(y_sorted.T, lasso_coefs.T) ax2.set_xlabel('True Coefficient'); ax2.set_ylabel('Estimated Coefficient'); ax2.legend(['OLS','Lasso'], fontsize=12);  make_figure_6_10()  We see that ridge regression shrinks every dimension of the data by the same proportion, whereas the lasso hrinks all coefficients toward zero by a similar amount, and sufficiently small coefficients are shrunken all the way to zero.\nSelecting the Tuning Parameter Implementing ridge regression and the lasso requires a method for selecting a value for the tuning parameter $\\lambda$.\nCross-validation provides a simple way to tackle this problem. We choose a grid of $\\lambda$ values, and compute the cross-validation error for each value of $\\lambda$. We then select the tuning parameter value for which the cross-validation error is smallest. Finally, the model is re-fit using all of the available observations and the selected value of the tuning parameter.\n# X and y categ_cols = [\u0026quot;Gender\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Student\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Married\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Ethnicity\u0026quot;] X = credit.loc[:, credit.columns != 'Balance'] X = pd.get_dummies(X, columns=categ_cols, drop_first=True).values y = credit.loc[:,'Balance'] n = len(credit)  We are going to use 10-fold CV as cross-validation algorithm.\n# Get MSE def cv_lasso(X,y,a): # Init mse mse = [] # Generate splits kf10 = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=None, shuffle=False) kf10.get_n_splits(X) # Loop over splits for train_index, test_index in kf10.split(X): X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index] y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index] lasso = Lasso(alpha=a).fit(X_train, y_train) y_hat = lasso.predict(X_test) mse.append(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_hat)) return np.mean(mse)  # Compute MSE over grid of alphas n_grid = 30 alphas = 10**np.linspace(0,3,n_grid).reshape(-1,1) MSE = [cv_lasso(X,y,a) for a in alphas]  What is the optimal $\\lambda$?\n# Find minimum alpha alpha_min = alphas[np.argmin(MSE)] print('Best alpha by 10fold CV:',alpha_min[0])  Best alpha by 10fold CV: 2.592943797404667  We now plot the objective function and the implied coefficients at the optimal $\\lambda$.\n# Get coefficients coefs = [] # Loop over values of alpha for a in alphas: lasso = Lasso(alpha=a).fit(scale(X), y) coefs.append(lasso.coef_) coefs = np.reshape(coefs,(n_grid,-1))  np.shape(coefs)  (30, 11)  # Figure 6.12 def make_figure_6_12(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2) fig.suptitle('Figure 6.12: Lasso 10-fold CV') # MSE by LOO CV ax1.plot(alphas, MSE, alpha=1); ax1.axvline(alpha_min, c='k', ls='--') ax1.set_xscale('log') ax1.set_xlabel('lambda'); ax1.set_ylabel('MSE'); highlight = [0,1,2,7]; # Plot coefficients - absolute ax2.plot(alphas, coefs[:,highlight], alpha=1) ax2.plot(alphas, coefs, c='grey', alpha=0.3) ax2.axvline(alpha_min, c='k', ls='--') ax2.set_xscale('log') ax2.set_xlabel('lambda'); ax2.set_ylabel('Standardized coefficients'); ax2.legend(['Income', 'Limit', 'Rating', 'Student'], fontsize=10);  make_figure_6_12()  ","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"2f1f6f919e48a777cab5eae3dcdcbc48","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/ml-econ/05_regularization/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/ml-econ/05_regularization/","section":"course","summary":"# Remove warnings import warnings warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')  # Import import pandas as pd import numpy as np import time import itertools import statsmodels.api as sm import seaborn as sns from numpy.","tags":null,"title":"Model Selection and Regularization","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Gauss Markov Model Definition A statistical model for regression data is the Gauss Markov Model if each of its distributions satisfies the conditions\n  Linearity: a statistical model $\\mathcal{F}$ over data $\\mathcal{D}$ satisfies linearity if for each element of $\\mathcal{F}$, the data can be decomposed in $$ \\begin{aligned} y_ i \u0026amp;= \\beta_ 1 x _ {i1} + \\dots + \\beta_ k x _ {ik} + \\varepsilon_ i = x_ i'\\beta + \\varepsilon_ i \\newline \\underset{n \\times 1}{\\vphantom{\\beta_ \\beta} y} \u0026amp;= \\underset{n \\times k}{\\vphantom{\\beta}X} \\cdot \\underset{k \\times 1}{\\beta} + \\underset{n \\times 1}{\\vphantom{\\beta}\\varepsilon} \\end{aligned} $$\n  Strict Exogeneity: $\\mathbb E [\\varepsilon_i|x_1, \\dots, x_n] = 0, \\forall i$.\n  No Multicollinerity: $\\mathbb E_n [x_i x_i']$ is strictly positive definite almost surely.

Projection A map $\\Pi: V \\to V$ is a projection if $\\Pi \\circ \\Pi = \\Pi$.\nThe Gauss Markov Model assumes that the conditional expectation function (CEF) $f(X) = \\mathbb E[Y|X]$ and the linear projection $g(X) = X \\beta$ coincide.\nCode - DGP This code draws 100 observations from the model $y = 2 x_1 - x_2 + \\varepsilon$ where $x_1, x_2 \\sim U[0,1]$ and $\\varepsilon \\sim N(0,1)$.\n# Set seed Random.seed!(123); # Set the number of observations n = 100; # Set the dimension of X k = 2; # Draw a sample of explanatory variables X = rand(Uniform(0,1), n, k); # Draw the error term σ = 1; ε = rand(Normal(0,1), n, 1) * sqrt(σ); # Set the parameters β = [2; -1]; # Calculate the dependent variable y = X*β + ε;  The OLS estimator Definition The sum of squared residuals (SSR) is given by $$ Q_n (\\beta) \\equiv \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\left( y_i - x_i'\\beta \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{n} (y - X\\beta)' (y - X \\beta) $$\nConsider a dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ and define $Q_n(\\beta) = \\mathbb E_n[(y_i - x_i'\\beta )^2 ]$. Then the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator $\\hat \\beta _ {OLS}$ is the value of $\\beta$ that minimizes $Q_n(\\beta)$.\nWhen we can write $D = (y, X)$ in matrix form, then $$ \\hat \\beta _ {OLS} = \\arg \\min_\\beta \\frac{1}{n} (y - X \\beta)' (y - X\\beta) $$\nDerivation Theorem\nUnder the assumption that $X$ has full rank, the OLS estimator is unique and it is determined by the normal equations. More explicitly, $\\hat \\beta$ is the OLS estimate precisely when $X\u0026rsquo;X \\hat \\beta = X\u0026rsquo;y$.\nProof\nTaking the FOC: $$ \\frac{\\partial Q_n (\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta} = -\\frac{2}{n} X' y + \\frac{2}{n} X\u0026rsquo;X\\beta = 0 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad X\u0026rsquo;X \\beta = X\u0026rsquo;y $$ Since $(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}$ exists by assumption,\nFinally, $\\frac{\\partial^2 Q_n (\\beta)}{\\partial \\beta \\partial \\beta'} = X\u0026rsquo;X/n$ is positive definite since $X\u0026rsquo;X$ is positive semi-definite and $(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}$ exists because $X$ is full rank. Therefore, $Q_n(\\beta)$ minimized at $\\hat \\beta_n$. $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nThe $k$ equations $X\u0026rsquo;X \\hat \\beta = X\u0026rsquo;y$ are called normal equations.\nFuther Objects  Fitted coefficient: $\\hat \\beta _ {OLS} = (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} X\u0026rsquo;y = \\mathbb E_n [x_i x_i'] \\mathbb E_n [x_i y_i]$ Fitted residual: $\\hat \\varepsilon_i = y_i - x_i'\\hat \\beta$ Fitted value: $\\hat y_i = x_i' \\hat \\beta$ Predicted coefficient: $\\hat \\beta _ {-i} = \\mathbb E_n [x _ {-i} x' _ {-i}] \\mathbb E_n [x _ {-i} y _ {-i}]$ Prediction error: $\\hat \\varepsilon _ {-i} = y_i - x_i'\\hat \\beta _ {-i}$ Predicted value: $\\hat y_i = x_i' \\hat \\beta _ {-i}$  Notes on Orthogonality Conditions  The normal equations are equivalent to the moment condition $\\mathbb E_n [x_i \\varepsilon_i]= 0$. The algebraic result $\\mathbb E_n [x_i \\hat \\varepsilon_i]= 0$ is called ortogonality property of the OLS residual $\\hat \\varepsilon_i$. If we have included a constant in the regression, $\\mathbb E_n [\\hat \\varepsilon_i] = 0$. $\\mathbb E \\Big[\\mathbb E_n [x_i \\varepsilon_i ] \\Big] = 0$ by strict exogeneity (assumed in GM), but $\\mathbb E_n [x_i \\varepsilon_i] \\ne \\mathbb E [x_i \\varepsilon_i] = 0$. This is why $\\hat \\beta _ {OLS}$ is just an estimate of $\\beta_0$. Calculating OLS is like replacing the $j$ equations $\\mathbb E [x _ {ij} \\varepsilon_i] = 0$ $\\forall j$ with $\\mathbb E_n [x _ {ij} \\varepsilon_i] = 0$ $\\forall j$ and forcing them to hold (remindful of GMM).  The Projection Matrix The projection matrix is given by $P = X(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} X'$. It has the following properties: - $PX = X$ - $P \\hat \\varepsilon = 0 \\quad$ ($P$, $\\varepsilon$ orthogonal) - $P y = X(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} X\u0026rsquo;y = X\\hat \\beta = \\hat y$ - Symmetric: $P=P'$, Idempotent: $PP = P$ - $tr(P) = tr( X(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} X') = tr( X\u0026rsquo;X(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}) = tr(I_k) = k$ - Its diagonal elements are $h_{ii} = x_i (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} x_i'$ and are called leverage.\n $h _ {ii} \\in [0,1]$ is a normalized length of the observed regressor vector $x_i$. In the OLS regression framework it captures the relative influence of observation $i$ on the estimated coefficient. Note that $\\sum _ n h_{ii} = k$.\n The Annihilator Matrix The annihilator matrix is given by $M = I_n - P$. It has the following properties: - $MX = 0 \\quad$ ($M$, $X$ orthogonal) - $M \\hat \\varepsilon = \\hat \\varepsilon$ - $M y = \\hat \\varepsilon$ - Symmetric: $M=M'$, idempotent: $MM = M$ - $tr(M) = n - k$ - Its diagonal elements are $1 - h_{ii} \\in [0,1]$\n Then we can equivalently write $\\hat y$ (defined by stacking $\\hat y_i$ into a vector) as $\\hat y = Py$.\n Estimating Beta # Estimate beta β_hat = inv(X'*X)*(X'*y)  ## 2×1 Array{Float64,2}: ## 1.8821600407711814 ## -0.9429354944506099  # Equivalent but faster formulation β_hat = (X'*X)\\(X'*y)  ## 2×1 Array{Float64,2}: ## 1.8821600407711816 ## -0.9429354944506098  # Even faster (but less intuitive) formulation β_hat = X\\y  ## 2×1 Array{Float64,2}: ## 1.8821600407711807 ## -0.9429354944506088  Equivalent Formulation?

In fact $$ \\mathbb E[\\hat \\sigma^2 | X] = \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb E [ tr(M \\varepsilon' \\varepsilon) | X] = \\frac{1}{n} tr( M\\mathbb E[\\varepsilon' \\varepsilon |X]) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n (1-h_{ii}) \\sigma^2_i $$\nUnder conditional homoskedasticity, the above expression simplifies to $$ \\mathbb E[\\hat \\sigma^2 | X] = \\frac{1}{n} tr(M) \\sigma^2 = \\frac{n-k}{n} \\sigma^2 $$\nSample Variance The OLS residual sample variance is denoted by $s^2$ and is given by $$ s^2 = \\frac{SSR}{n-k} = \\frac{\\hat \\varepsilon'\\hat \\varepsilon}{n-k} = \\frac{1}{n-k}\\sum _ {i=1}^n \\hat \\varepsilon_i^2 $$ Furthermore, the square root of $s^2$, denoted $s$, is called the standard error of the regression (SER) or the standard error of the equation (SEE).

Decompose $b$ as $$ \\begin{aligned} b \u0026amp;= (D + A) y = \\newline \u0026amp;= Dy + Ay = \\newline\n\u0026amp;= D (X\\beta + \\varepsilon) + \\hat \\beta = \\newline \u0026amp;= DX\\beta + D \\varepsilon + \\hat \\beta \\end{aligned} $$ By assumption, $b$ must be unbiased: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb E [b|X] \u0026amp;= \\mathbb E [D(X\\beta + \\varepsilon) + Ay |X] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\mathbb E [DX\\beta|X] + \\mathbb E [D\\varepsilon |X] + \\mathbb E [\\hat \\beta |X] = \\newline \u0026amp;= DX\\beta + D \\mathbb E [\\varepsilon |X] +\\beta \\newline\n\u0026amp;= DX\\beta + \\beta \\end{aligned} $$ Hence, it must be that $DX = 0$  BLUE Proof (2)  We know by (2)-(3) that $b = D \\varepsilon + \\hat \\beta$. We can now calculate its variance. $$ \\begin{aligned} Var (b|X) \u0026amp;= Var (\\hat \\beta + D\\varepsilon|X) = \\newline \u0026amp;= Var (Ay + D\\varepsilon|X) = \\newline \u0026amp;= Var (AX\\beta + (D + A)\\varepsilon|X) = \\newline \u0026amp;= Var((D+A)\\varepsilon |X) = \\newline \u0026amp;= (D+A)\\sigma^2 I (D+A)' = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\sigma^2 I (DD' + AA' + DA' + AD') = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\sigma^2 I (DD' + AA') \\geq \\newline \u0026amp;\\geq \\sigma^2 AA'= \\newline \u0026amp;= \\sigma^2 (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} = \\newline \u0026amp;= Var (\\hat \\beta|X) \\end{aligned} $$ since $DA'= AD' = 0$, $DX = 0$ and $AA' = (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}$. $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$   $Var(b | X) \\geq Var (\\hat{\\beta} | X)$ is meant in a positive definite sense.\n Code - Variance # Ideal variance of the OLS estimator var_β = σ * inv(X'*X)  ## 2×2 Array{Float64,2}: ## 0.0609402 -0.0467732 ## -0.0467732 0.0656808  # Standard errors std_β = sqrt.(diag(var_β))  ## 2-element Array{Float64,1}: ## 0.24686077212177054 ## 0.25628257446345265  ","date":1635465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635465600,"objectID":"ff820c54188a6875670d383b4784b4c5","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/metrics/05_ols_algebra/","publishdate":"2021-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/metrics/05_ols_algebra/","section":"course","summary":"The Gauss Markov Model Definition A statistical model for regression data is the Gauss Markov Model if each of its distributions satisfies the conditions\n  Linearity: a statistical model $\\mathcal{F}$ over data $\\mathcal{D}$ satisfies linearity if for each element of $\\mathcal{F}$, the data can be decomposed in $$ \\begin{aligned} y_ i \u0026amp;= \\beta_ 1 x _ {i1} + \\dots + \\beta_ k x _ {ik} + \\varepsilon_ i = x_ i'\\beta + \\varepsilon_ i \\newline \\underset{n \\times 1}{\\vphantom{\\beta_ \\beta} y} \u0026amp;= \\underset{n \\times k}{\\vphantom{\\beta}X} \\cdot \\underset{k \\times 1}{\\beta} + \\underset{n \\times 1}{\\vphantom{\\beta}\\varepsilon} \\end{aligned} $$","tags":null,"title":"OLS Algebra","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this notebook, we are going to build a pipeline for a general prediction problem.\n# Standard Imports from src.utils import * from src.get_feature_names import get_feature_names  # Set inline graphs plt.style.use('seaborn') %matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  Introduction Usually, in machine learning prediction tasks, the data consists in 3 files:\n X_train.csv y_train.csv X_test.csv  The purpose of the exercise is to produce a y_test.csv file, with the predicted values corresponding to the X_test.csv observations.\nThe functions we will write are going to be general and will adapt to any type of dataset, and we will test them on the House Prices Dataset which is a standard dataset for these kind of tasks.

We need to separate the training data into two parts:\n X: the features y: the target  # Select the features X_train = df_train.drop(['SalePrice'], axis=1) X_test = df_test # Check size print(f\u0026quot;Training features: {np.shape(X_train)} \\n Testing features: {np.shape(X_test)}\u0026quot;)  Training features: (1460, 80) Testing features: (1459, 80)  # Select the target y_train = df_train['SalePrice'] # Check size print(f\u0026quot;Training target: {np.shape(y_train)}\u0026quot;)  Training target: (1460,)  It\u0026rsquo;s good practice to immediately set aside a validation sample with 20% of the observations. The purpose of the validation sample is to give us unbiased estimate of the prediction score. Therefore, we want to set it aside as soon as possible, not to be conditioned in any way by it. Possibly, set it away even before data exploration.\nThe more we tune the algorithm based on the feedback received from the validation sample, the more biased our estimate is going to be. Ideally, one would use only cross-validation on the training data and tune only a couple of times using the validation data.\n# Set aside the validation sample X_train, X_validation, y_train, y_validation = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2)  Now we are ready to build and test our pipeline.\nData Exploration First, let\u0026rsquo;s have a quick look at the data.\nX_train.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Id MSSubClass MSZoning LotFrontage LotArea Street Alley LotShape LandContour Utilities ...

We will have to deal with that.\nPre-processing First, let\u0026rsquo;s process numerical variables. We want to do two things:\n inpute missing values standardize all variables  Which imputer should to use? It depends on the type of missing data:\n  Missing absolutely at random: as the name says, in this case we believe that missing values are distributed uniformly at random, independently across variables.\n In this case, the only information on missing values comes from the distribution of non-missing values of the same variable. No information on missing values is contained in other variables.    Missing at random: in this case, missing values are random, conditional on values of other observed variables.\n In this case, information in other variables might help filling missing values.    Missing non at random: in this last case, missing values depend on information that we do not observe.\n This is the most tricky category of missing values since data alone does not tell us which values might be missing. For example, we might have that older women might be less likely to report the age. If we consider the data missing at random (absolutely or not), we would underestimate the missing ages. External information such as the sample population might help. For example, we could estimate the probability of not reporting the age and fill the missing values with the expected age, conditional on age not being reported.    So, which imputers are readily available in sklearn for numerical data?\nFor data missing absolutely at random, there is one standard sklearn library: SimpleImputer(). It allows different strategy options such as\n \u0026quot;mean\u0026quot; \u0026quot;median\u0026quot; \u0026quot;most_frequent\u0026quot;  For data missing at random, there are multiple sklearn libraries:\n KNNImputer(): uses KNN IterativeImputer(): uses a variety of ML algorithms  see comparison here    After we have inputed missing values, we want to standardize numerical variables to make the algorithm more efficient and robust to outliers.\nThe two main options for standardization are:\n StandardScaler(): which normalizes each variable to mean zero and unit variance MinMaxScaler(): which normalizes each variable to an interval between zero an one  # Inputer for numerical variables num = Pipeline(steps=[ ('ii', IterativeImputer()), ('ss', StandardScaler()) ])  For categorical variables, we do not have to worry about scaling. However, we still need to impute missing values and, crucially, we need to transform them into numerical variables. This process is called encoding.\nWhich imputer should to use?\nFor data missing absolutely at random, the only available strategy option for SimpleImputer() is\n \u0026quot;most_frequent\u0026quot;  For data missing at random, we can still use both\n KNNImputer() IterativeImputer()  For encoding categorical variables, the standard option is OneHotEncoder() which generates unique binary variables out of every values of the categorical variable.\n# One Hot Encoder for categorical data cat = Pipeline(steps=[ ('si', SimpleImputer(strategy=\u0026quot;most_frequent\u0026quot;)), ('ohe', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=\u0026quot;ignore\u0026quot;)), ])  # Preprocess column transformer for preprocessing data preprocess = ColumnTransformer( transformers=[ ('num', num, numerical_cols), ('cat', cat, categorical_cols), ])  Information and components How much information is contained in our dataset? It is a dense or sparse dataset?\nX_clean = num.fit_transform(X_numerical) pca = PCA().fit(X_clean) explained_variance = pca.explained_variance_ratio_  fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(15,6)) fig.suptitle('Principal Component Analysis', fontsize=16); # Relative ax1.plot(range(len(explained_variance)), explained_variance) ax1.set_ylabel('Prop.

Is the distribution of our objective variable the same in the training and in the test sample? If it is not the case, we might get a poor performance just because our training sample is not representative of our testing sample.\nThis is something that usually we cannot test, since we do not have access to the distribution of the target variable in the test data.

\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Projected gradient descent. Inputs: initial: starting point steps: list of scalar step sizes grad: function mapping points to gradients proj (optional): function mapping points to points Returns: List of all points computed by projected gradient descent. \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; xs = [init] for step in steps: xs.append(proj(xs[-1] - step * grad(xs[-1]))) return xs  Note that this implementation keeps around all points computed along the way. This is clearly not what you would do on large instances. We do this for illustrative purposes to be able to easily inspect the computed sequence of points.\nWarm-up: Optimizing a quadratic As a toy example, let\u0026rsquo;s optimize $$f(x)=\\frac12|x|^2,$$ which has the gradient map $\\nabla f(x)=x.$\ndef quadratic(x): return 0.5*x.dot(x) def quadratic_gradient(x): return x  Note the function is $1$-smooth and $1$-strongly convex. Our theorems would then suggest that we use a constant step size of $1.$ If you think about it, for this step size the algorithm will actually find the optimal solution in just one step.\nx0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, (1000)) _, x1 = gradient_descent(x0, [1.0], quadratic_gradient)  Indeed, it does.\nx1.all() == 0  True  Let\u0026rsquo;s say we don\u0026rsquo;t have the right learning rate.\nxs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.1]*50, quadratic_gradient)  # Plot errors along steps error_plot([quadratic(x) for x in xs])  Constrained Optimization Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to optimize the function inside some affine subspace. Recall that affine subspaces are convex sets. Below we pick a random low dimensional affine subspace $b+U$ and define the corresponding linear projection operator.\n# U is an orthonormal basis of a random 100-dimensional subspace. U = np.linalg.qr(np.random.normal(0, 1, (1000, 100)))[0] b = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000) def proj(x): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Projection of x onto an affine subspace\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; return b + U.dot(U.T).dot(x-b)  x0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, (1000)) xs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.1]*50, quadratic_gradient, proj) # the optimal solution is the projection of the origin x_opt = proj(0)  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the results.\nerror_plot([quadratic(x) for x in xs]) plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [quadratic(x_opt)]*len(xs), label='$\\\\frac{1}{2}|\\!|x_{\\mathrm{opt}}|\\!|^2$') plt.legend();  The orangle line shows the optimal error, which the algorithm reaches quickly.\nThe iterates also converge to the optimal solution in domain as the following plot shows.\nerror_plot([np.linalg.norm(x_opt-x)**2 for x in xs])  Least Squares One of the most fundamental data analysis tools is linear least squares. Given an $m\\times n$ matrix $A$ and a vector $b$ our goal is to find a vector $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ that minimizes the following objective:\n $$f(x) = \\frac 1{2m}\\sum_{i=1}^m (a_i^\\top x - b_j)^2 =\\frac1{2m}\\|Ax-b\\|^2$$ We can verify that $\\nabla f(x) = A^\\top(Ax-b)$ and $\\nabla^2 f(x) = A^\\top A.$\nHence, the objective is $\\beta$-smooth with $\\beta=\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}(A^\\top A)$, and $\\alpha$-strongly convex with $\\alpha=\\lambda_{\\mathrm{min}}(A^\\top A)$.\ndef least_squares(A, b, x): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Least squares objective.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; return (0.5/m) * np.linalg.norm(A.dot(x)-b)**2 def least_squares_gradient(A, b, x): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Gradient of least squares objective at x.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; return A.T.dot(A.dot(x)-b)/m  Overdetermined case $m\\ge n$ m, n = 1000, 100 A = np.random.normal(0, 1, (m, n)) x_opt = np.random.normal(0, 1, n) noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, m) b = A.dot(x_opt) + noise objective = lambda x: least_squares(A, b, x) gradient = lambda x: least_squares_gradient(A, b, x)  Convergence in Objective x0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, n) xs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.1]*100, gradient)  error_plot([objective(x) for x in xs]) plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [np.linalg.norm(noise)**2]*len(xs), label='noise level') plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [least_squares(A,b,x_opt)]*len(xs), label='optimal') plt.legend();  Convergence in Domain error_plot([np.linalg.norm(x-x_opt)**2 for x in xs])  Underdetermined Case $m \u0026lt; n$ In the underdetermined case, the least squares objective is inevitably not strongly convex, since $A^\\top A$ is a rank deficient matrix and hence $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{min}}(A^\\top A)=0.$\nm, n = 100, 1000 A = np.random.normal(0, 1, (m, n)) b = np.random.normal(0, 1, m) # The least norm solution is given by the pseudo-inverse x_opt = np.linalg.pinv(A).dot(b) objective = lambda x: least_squares(A, b, x) gradient = lambda x: least_squares_gradient(A, b, x) x0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, n) xs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.1]*100, gradient)  Results.\nerror_plot([objective(x) for x in xs]) plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [least_squares(A,b,x_opt)]*len(xs), label='optimal') plt.legend();  While we quickly reduce the error, we don\u0026rsquo;t actually converge in domain to the least norm solution. This is just because the function is no longer strongly convex in the underdetermined case.\nerror_plot([np.linalg.norm(x-x_opt)**2 for x in xs], yscale='linear') plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [np.linalg.norm(x_opt)**2]*len(xs), label='$|\\!|x_{\\mathrm{opt}}|\\!|^2$') plt.legend();  $\\ell_2$-regularized least squares In the underdetermined case, it is often desirable to restore strong convexity of the objective function by adding an $\\ell_2^2$-penality, also known as Tikhonov regularization, $\\ell_2$-regularization, or weight decay.\n $$\\frac1{2m}\\|Ax-b\\|^2 + \\frac{\\alpha}2\\|x\\|^2$$ Note: With this modification the objective is $\\alpha$-strongly convex again.\ndef least_squares_l2(A, b, x, alpha=0.1): return least_squares(A, b, x) + (alpha/2) * x.dot(x) def least_squares_l2_gradient(A, b, x, alpha=0.1): return least_squares_gradient(A, b, x) + alpha * x  Let\u0026rsquo;s create a least squares instance.\nm, n = 100, 1000 A = np.random.normal(0, 1, (m, n)) b = A.dot(np.random.normal(0, 1, n)) objective = lambda x: least_squares_l2(A, b, x) gradient = lambda x: least_squares_l2_gradient(A, b, x)  Note that we can find the optimal solution to the optimization problem in closed form without even running gradient descent by computing $x_{\\mathrm{opt}}=(A^\\top+\\alpha I)^{-1}A^\\top b.$ Please verify that this point is indeed optimal.\nx_opt = np.linalg.inv(A.T.dot(A) + 0.1*np.eye(1000)).dot(A.T).dot(b)  Here\u0026rsquo;s how gradient descent fares.\nx0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, n) xs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.1]*500, gradient)  We plot the descent.\nerror_plot([objective(x) for x in xs]) plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [least_squares_l2(A,b,x_opt)]*len(xs), label='optimal') plt.legend();  You see that the error doesn\u0026rsquo;t decrease below a certain level due to the regularization term. This is not a bad thing. In fact, the regularization term gives as strong convexity which leads to convergence in domain again:\nxs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.1]*500, gradient)  error_plot([np.linalg.norm(x-x_opt)**2 for x in xs]) plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [np.linalg.norm(x_opt)**2]*len(xs), label='squared norm of $x_{\\mathrm{opt}}$') plt.legend();  The Magic of Implicit Regularization Sometimes simply running gradient descent from a suitable initial point has a regularizing effect on its own without introducing an explicit regularization term.\nWe will see this below where we revisit the unregularized least squares objective, but initialize gradient descent from the origin rather than a random gaussian point.\n# We initialize from 0 x0 = np.zeros(n) # Note this is the gradient w.r.t. the unregularized objective! gradient = lambda x: least_squares_gradient(A, b, x) xs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.1]*50, gradient) error_plot([np.linalg.norm(x_opt-x)**2 for x in xs], yscale='linear') plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [np.linalg.norm(x_opt)**2]*len(xs), label='$|\\!|x_{\\mathrm{opt}}|\\!|^2$') plt.legend();  Incredible! We converge to the minimum norm solution!\nImplicit regularization is a deep phenomenon that\u0026rsquo;s an active research topic in learning and optimization. It\u0026rsquo;s exciting that we see it play out in this simple least squares problem already!\nLASSO LASSO is the name for $\\ell_1$-regularized least squares regression:\n $$\\frac1{2m}\\|Ax-b\\|^2 + \\alpha\\|x\\|_1$$ We will see that LASSO is able to fine sparse solutions if they exist. This is a common motivation for using an $\\ell_1$-regularizer.\ndef lasso(A, b, x, alpha=0.1): return least_squares(A, b, x) + alpha * np.linalg.norm(x, 1) def ell1_subgradient(x): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Subgradient of the ell1-norm at x.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; g = np.ones(x.shape) g[x \u0026lt; 0.] = -1.0 return g def lasso_subgradient(A, b, x, alpha=0.1): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Subgradient of the lasso objective at x\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; return least_squares_gradient(A, b, x) + alpha*ell1_subgradient(x)  m, n = 100, 1000 A = np.random.normal(0, 1, (m, n)) x_opt = np.zeros(n) x_opt[:10] = 1.0 b = A.dot(x_opt) x0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, n) xs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.1]*500, lambda x: lasso_subgradient(A, b, x))  error_plot([lasso(A, b, x) for x in xs])  plt.figure() plt.title('Comparison of initial, optimal, and computed point') idxs = range(50) plt.plot(idxs, x0[idxs], '--', color='#aaaaaa', label='initial') plt.plot(idxs, x_opt[idxs], 'r-', label='optimal') plt.plot(idxs, xs[-1][idxs], 'g-', label='final') plt.xlabel('Coordinate') plt.ylabel('Value') plt.legend();  As promised, LASSO correctly identifies the significant coordinates of the optimal solution. This is why, in practice, LASSO is a popular tool for feature selection.\nPlay around with this plot to inspect other points along the way, e.g., the point that achieves lowest objective value. Why does the objective value go up even though we continue to get better solutions?\nSupport Vector Machines In a linear classification problem, we\u0026rsquo;re given $m$ labeled points $(a_i, y_i)$ and we wish to find a hyperplane given by a point $x$ that separates them so that\n $\\langle a_i, x\\rangle \\ge 1$ when $y_i=1$, and $\\langle a_i, x\\rangle \\le -1$ when $y_i = -1$  The smaller the norm $|x|$ the larger the margin between positive and negative instances. Therefore, it makes sense to throw in a regularizer that penalizes large norms. This leads to the objective.\n $$\\frac 1m \\sum_{i=1}^m \\max\\{1-y_i(a_i^\\top x), 0\\} + \\frac{\\alpha}2\\|x\\|^2$$ def hinge_loss(z): return np.maximum(1.-z, np.zeros(z.shape)) def svm_objective(A, y, x, alpha=0.1): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;SVM objective.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; m, _ = A.shape return np.mean(hinge_loss(np.diag(y).dot(A.dot(x))))+(alpha/2)*x.dot(x)  z = np.linspace(-2, 2, 100)  plt.figure() plt.plot(z, hinge_loss(z));  def hinge_subgradient(z): g = np.zeros(z.shape) g[z \u0026lt; 1] = -1. return g def svm_subgradient(A, y, x, alpha=0.1): g1 = hinge_subgradient(np.diag(y).dot(A.dot(x))) g2 = np.diag(y).dot(A) return g1.dot(g2) + alpha*x  plt.figure() plt.plot(z, hinge_subgradient(z));  m, n = 1000, 100 A = np.vstack([np.random.normal(0.1, 1, (m//2, n)), np.random.normal(-0.1, 1, (m//2, n))]) y = np.hstack([np.ones(m//2), -1.*np.ones(m//2)]) x0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, n) xs = gradient_descent(x0, [0.01]*100, lambda x: svm_subgradient(A, y, x, 0.05))  error_plot([svm_objective(A, y, x) for x in xs])  Let\u0026rsquo;s see if averaging out the solutions gives us an improved function value.\nxavg = 0.0 for x in xs: xavg += x svm_objective(A, y, xs[-1]), svm_objective(A, y, xavg/len(xs))  (1.0710162653835846, 0.9069593413738611)  We can also look at the accuracy of our linear model for predicting the labels. From how we defined the data, we can see that the all ones vector is the highest accuracy classifier in the limit of infinite data (very large $m$). For a finite data set, the accuracy could be even higher due to random fluctuations.\ndef accuracy(A, y, x): return np.mean(np.diag(y).dot(A.dot(x))\u0026gt;0)  plt.figure() plt.ylabel('Accuracy') plt.xlabel('Step') plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [accuracy(A, y, x) for x in xs]) plt.plot(range(len(xs)), [accuracy(A, y, np.ones(n))]*len(xs), label='Population optimum') plt.legend();  We see that the accuracy spikes pretty early and drops a bit as we train for too long.\nSparse Inverse Covariance Estimation Given a positive semidefinite matrix $S\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ the objective function in sparse inverse covariance estimation is as follows:\n $$ \\min_{X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}, X\\succeq 0} \\langle S, X\\rangle - \\log\\det(X) + \\alpha\\|X\\|_1$$ Here, we define $$\\langle S, X\\rangle = \\mathrm{trace}(S^\\top X)$$ and $$|X|1 = \\sum{ij}|X_{ij}|.$$\nTypically, we think of the matrix $S$ as a sample covariance matrix of a set of vectors $a_1,\\dots, a_m,$ defined as: $$ S = \\frac1{m-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n a_ia_i^\\top $$ The example also highlights the utility of automatic differentiation as provided by the autograd package that we\u0026rsquo;ll regularly use. In a later lecture we will understand exactly how automatic differentiation works. For now we just treat it as a blackbox that gives us gradients.\nnp.random.seed(1337)  def sparse_inv_cov(S, X, alpha=0.1): return (np.trace(S.T.dot(X)) - np.log(np.linalg.det(X)) + alpha * np.sum(np.abs(X)))  n = 5 A = np.random.normal(0, 1, (n, n)) S = A.dot(A.T) objective = lambda X: sparse_inv_cov(S, X) # autograd provides a \u0026quot;gradient\u0026quot;, yay! gradient = grad(objective)  We also need to worry about the projection onto the positive semidefinite cone, which corresponds to truncating eigenvalues.\ndef projection(X): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Projection onto positive semidefinite cone.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; es, U = np.linalg.eig(X) es[es\u0026lt;0] = 0. return U.dot(np.diag(es).dot(U.T))  A0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, (n,n)) X0 = A0.dot(A0.T) Xs = gradient_descent(X0, [0.01]*500, gradient, projection) error_plot([objective(X) for X in Xs])  Going crazy with autograd Just for fun, we\u0026rsquo;ll go through a crazy example below. We can use autograd not just for getting gradients for natural objectives, we can in principle also use it to tune hyperparameters of our optimizer, like the step size schedulde.\nBelow we see how we can find a better 10-step learning rate schedules for optimizing a quadratic. This is mostly just for illustrative purposes (although some researchers are exploring these kinds of ideas more seriously).\nx0 = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)  def f(x): return 0.5*np.dot(x,x) def optimizer(steps): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Optimize a quadratic with the given steps.\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; xs = gradient_descent(x0, steps, grad(f)) return f(xs[-1])  The function optimizer is a non-differentiable function of its input steps. Nontheless, autograd will provide a gradient that we can stick into gradient descent. That is, we\u0026rsquo;re tuning gradient descent with gradient descent.\ngrad_optimizer = grad(optimizer)  initial_steps = np.abs(np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 10)) better_steps = gradient_descent(initial_steps, [0.001]*500, grad_optimizer)  error_plot([optimizer(steps) for steps in better_steps])  As we can see, the learning rate schedules improve dramatically over time. Of course, we already know from the first example that there is a step size schedule that converges in one step. Interestingly, the last schedule we find here doesn\u0026rsquo;t look at all like what we might expect:\nplt.figure() plt.xticks(range(len(better_steps[-1]))) plt.ylabel('Step size') plt.xlabel('Step number') plt.plot(range(len(better_steps[-1])), better_steps[-1]);  ","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"95b7f39b86cd1dae5bb9b292f50b65a4","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/ml-econ/06_convexity/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/ml-econ/06_convexity/","section":"course","summary":"# Remove warnings import warnings warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')  # Import import autograd.numpy as np from autograd import grad import seaborn as sns  # Import matplotlib for graphs import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl_toolkits.","tags":null,"title":"Convexity and Optimization","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Instrumental Variables Endogeneity We say that there is endogeneity in the linear regression model if $\\mathbb E[x_i \\varepsilon_i] \\neq 0$.\nThe random vector $z_i$ is an instrumental variable in the linear regression model if the following conditions are met.\n Exclusion restriction: the instruments are uncorrelated with the regression error $$ \\mathbb E_n[z_i \\varepsilon_i] = 0 $$ almost surely, i.e. with probability $p \\to 1$.

(The $\\delta$ that does it is the IV estimator.)\nIf the equations are overidentified, i.e. $L$ (number of instruments) $\u0026gt; K$ (number of equations), then the distance cannot be zero exactly in general, but we would expect the minimized distance to be close to zero.\nNaive Test Suppose your model is overidentified ($L \u0026gt; K$) and you use the following naive testing procedure:\n Estimate $\\hat{\\delta}$ using a subset of dimension $K$ of instruments $\\lbrace z_1 , .. , z_K\\rbrace$ for $\\lbrace x_1 , \u0026hellip; , x_K\\rbrace$ Set $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i = y_i - x_i \\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{GMM}}$ Infer the size of the remaining $L-K$ moment conditions $\\mathbb E[z _{i, K+1} \\varepsilon_i], \u0026hellip;, \\mathbb E[z _{i, L} \\varepsilon_i]$ looking at their empirical counterparts $\\mathbb E_n[z _{i, K+1} \\hat{\\varepsilon}_i], \u0026hellip;, \\mathbb E_n[z _{i, L} \\hat{\\varepsilon}_i]$ Reject exogeneity if the empirical expectations are high. How high? Calculate p-values.  Example If you have two invalid instruments and you use one to test the validity of the other, it might happen by chance that you don’t reject it.\n  Model: $y_i = x_i + \\varepsilon_i$ and $x_i = \\frac{1}{2} z _{i1} - \\frac{1}{2} z _{i2} + u_i$\n  Have $$ Cov (z _{i1}, z _{i2}, \\varepsilon_i, u_i) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\newline 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\newline 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0.5 \\newline 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0.5 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n  You want to test whether the second instrument is valid (is not since $\\mathbb E[z_2 \\varepsilon] \\neq 0$).

This is a specification test, testing whether all model assumptions are true jointly. Only when we are confident that about the other assumptions, can we interpret a large $J$ statistic as evidence for the endogeneity of some of the $L$ instruments included in $x$. Unlike the tests we have encountered so far, the test is not consistent against some failures of the orthogonality conditions (that is, it is not consistent against some fixed elements of the alternative). Several papers in the July 1996 issue of JBES report that the finite-sample null rejection probability of the test can far exceed the nominal significance level $\\alpha$.  Special Case: Conditional Homoskedasticity The main implication of conditional homoskedasticity is that efficient GMM becomes 2SLS. With efficient GMM estimation, the weighting matrix is $\\hat{S}^{-1} = \\mathbb En [z_i z_i' \\varepsilon_i^2]^{-1}$. With conditional homoskedasticity, the efficient weighting matrix is $\\mathbb E_n[z_iz_i']^{-1} \\sigma^{-2}$, or equivalently $\\mathbb E_n[z_iz_i']^{-1}$. Then, the GMM estimator becomes $$ \\hat{\\delta}(\\hat{S}^{-1}) = \\Big(\\mathbb E_n[z_i x_i']' \\underbrace{\\mathbb E_n[z_iz_i']^{-1} \\mathbb E[z_i x_i']} _ {\\text{ols of } x_i \\text{ on }z_i} \\Big)^{-1}\\mathbb E_n[z_i x_i']' \\underbrace{\\mathbb E_n[z_iz_i']^{-1} \\mathbb E[z_i y_i']} _ {\\text{ols of } y_i \\text{ on }z_i}= \\hat{\\delta} _ {2SLS} $$\nProof: Consider the matrix notation. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\delta} \\left( \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;Z}{n}\\right) \u0026amp;= \\left( \\frac{X\u0026rsquo;Z}{n} \\left( \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;Z}{n}\\right)^{-1} \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;X}{n} \\right)^{-1} \\frac{X\u0026rsquo;Z}{n} \\left( \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;Z}{n}\\right)^{-1} \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;Y}{n} = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left( X\u0026rsquo;Z(Z\u0026rsquo;Z)^{-1} Z\u0026rsquo;X \\right)^{-1} X\u0026rsquo;Z(Z\u0026rsquo;Z)^{-1} Z\u0026rsquo;Y = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left(X\u0026rsquo;P_ZX\\right)^{-1} X\u0026rsquo;P_ZY = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left(X\u0026rsquo;P_ZP_ZX\\right)^{-1} X\u0026rsquo;P_ZY = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left(\\hat{X}'_Z \\hat{X}_Z\\right)^{-1} \\hat{X}'_ZY = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\hat{\\delta} _ {2SLS} \\end{aligned} $$ $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nSmall-Sample Properties of 2SLS Theorem: When the number of instruments is equal to the sample size ($L = n$), then $\\hat{\\delta} _ {2SLS} = \\hat{\\delta} _ {OLS}$\nProof: We have a perfect prediction problem.

This problem arises even if the instruments are valid.\n Example from Angrist (1992)  They regress wages on years of schooling. Problem: endogeneity: both variables are correlated with skills which are unobserved. Solution: instrument years of schooling with the quarter of birth.  Idea: if born in the first three quarters, can attend school from the year of your sixth birthday. Otherwise, you have to wait one more year.   Problem: quarters of birth are three dummies.  In order to ``improve the first stage fit” they interact them with year of birth (180 effective instruments) and also with the state (1527 effective instruments). This mechanically increases the $R^2$ but also increases the bias of the 2SLS estimator.   Solutions: LIML, JIVE, RJIVE (Hansen et al., 2014), Post-Lasso (Belloni et al., 2012).  Example from Angrist (1992) Many Instrument Robust Estimation Issue Why having too many instruments is problematic? As the number of instruments increases, the estimated coefficient gets closer to OLS which is biased. As seen in the theorem above, for $L=n$, the two estimators coincide.\nLIML An alternative method to estimate the parameters of the structural equation is by maximum likelihood. Anderson and Rubin (1949) derived the maximum likelihood estimator for the joint distribution of $(y_i, x_i)$. The estimator is known as limited information maximum likelihood, or LIML.\nThis estimator is called “limited information” because it is based on the structural equation for $(y_i, x_i)$ combined with the reduced form equation for $x_i$. If maximum likelihood is derived based on a structural equation for $x_i$ as well, then this leads to what is known as full information maximum likelihood (FIML). The advantage of the LIML approach relative to FIML is that the former does not require a structural model for $x_i$, and thus allows the researcher to focus on the structural equation of interest - that for $y_i$.\nK-class Estimators The k-class estimators have the form $$ \\hat{\\delta}(\\alpha) = (X' P_Z X - \\alpha X' X)^{-1} (X' P_Z Y - \\alpha X' Y) $$\nThe limited information maximum likelihood estimator LIML is the k-class estimator $\\hat{\\delta}(\\alpha)$ where $$ \\alpha = \\lambda_{min} \\Big( ([X' , Y]^{-1} [X' , Y])^{-1} [X' , Y]^{-1} P_Z [X' , Y] \\Big) $$\nIf $\\alpha = 0$ then $\\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{LIML}} = \\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{2SLS}}$ while for $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, $\\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{LIML}} \\to \\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{OLS}}$.\nComments on LIML  The particular choice of $\\alpha$ gives a many instruments robust estimate The LIML estimator has no finite sample moments. $\\mathbb E[\\delta(\\alpha_{LIML})]$ does not exist in general In simulation studies performs well Has good asymptotic properties  Asymptotically the LIML estimator has the same distribution as 2SLS. However, they can have quite different behaviors in finite samples. There is considerable evidence that the LIML estimator has superior finite sample performance to 2SLS when there are many instruments or the reduced form is weak. However, on the other hand there is worry that since the LIML estimator is derived under normality it may not be robust in non-normal settings.\nJIVE The Jacknife IV procedure is the following\n Regress $\\lbrace x_j \\rbrace _ {j \\neq i}$ on $\\lbrace z_j \\rbrace _ {j \\neq i}$ and estimate $\\pi_{-i}$ (leave the $i^{th}$ observation out). Form $\\hat{x}_i = \\hat{\\pi} _ {-i} z_i$. Run IV using $\\hat{x}_i$ as instruments. $$ \\hat{\\delta} _ {JIVE} = \\mathbb E_n[\\hat{x}_i x_i']^{-1} \\mathbb E_n[\\hat{x}_i y_i'] $$  Comments on JIVE:  Prevents overfitting. With many instruments you get bad out of sample prediction which implies low correlation between $\\hat{x}_i$ and $x_i$: $\\mathbb E_n[\\hat{x}_i x_i'] \\simeq 0$. Use lasso/ridge regression in the first stage in case of too many instruments.  Hausman Test Here we consider testing the validity of OLS. OLS is generally preferred to IV in terms of precision. Many researchers only doubt the (joint) validity of the regressor $z_i$ instead of being certain that it is invalid (in the sense of not being predetermined). So then they wish to choose between OLS and 2SLS, assuming that they have an instrument vector $x_i$ whose validity is not in question. Further, assume for simplicity that $L = K$ so that the efficient GMM estimator is the IV estimator.\nThe Hausman test statistic $$ H \\equiv n (\\hat{\\delta} _ {IV} - \\hat{\\delta} _ {OLS})' [\\hat{Avar} (\\hat{\\delta} _ {IV} - \\hat{\\delta} _ {OLS})]^{-1} (\\hat{\\delta} _ {IV} - \\hat{\\delta} _ {OLS}) $$ is asymptotically distributed as a $\\chi^2_{L-s}$ under the null where $s = | z_i \\cup x_i |$: the number of regressors that are retained as instruments in $x_i$.\nComments In general, the idea of the Hausman test is the following. If you have two estimators, one which is efficient under $H_0$ but inconsistent under $H_1$ (in this case, OLS), and another which is consistent under $H_1$ (in this case, IV), then construct a test as a quadratic form in the differences of the estimators. Another classic example arises in panel data with the hypothesis $H_0$ of unconditional strict exogeneity. In that case, under $H_0$ Random Effects estimators are efficient but under $H_1$ they are inconsistent. Fixed Effects estimators instead are consistent under $H_1$.\nThe Hausman test statistic can be used as a pretest procedure: select either OLS or IV according to the outcome of the test. Although widely used, this pretest procedure is not advisable. When the null is false, it is still possible that the test accepts the null (committing a Type 2 error). In particular, this can happen with a high probability when the sample size is small and/or when the regressor $z_i$ is almost valid. In such an instance, estimation and also inference will be based on incorrect methods. Therefore, the overall properties of the Hausman pretest procedure are undesirable.\nThe Hausman test is an example of a specification test. There are many other specification tests. One could for example test for conditional homoskedasticity. Unlike for the OLS case, there does not exist a convenient test for conditional homoskedasticity for the GMM case. A test statistic that is asymptotically chi-squared under the null is available but is extremely cumbersome; see White (1982, note 2).

On the other hand, if $h \\simeq n$, $\\hat{\\Omega}^{HAC}$ does not converge in probability because it’s too noisy.\nChoice of h How to choose $h$? Look at the score autocorrelation function (ACF).\nIt looks like after 10 periods the empirical autocorrelation is quite small but still not zero.\nFixed b Asymptotics [Neave, 1970]: “When proving results on the asymptotic behavior of estimates of the spectrum of a stationary time series, it is invariably assumed that as the sample size $n$ tends to infinity, so does the truncation point $h$, but at a slower rate, so that $\\frac{h}{n}$ tends to zero. This is a convenient assumption mathematically in that, in particular, it ensures consistency of the estimates, but it is unrealistic when such results are used as approximations to the finite case where the value of $\\frac{h}{n}$ cannot be zero.””\nFixed b Theorem Theorem\nUnder regularity conditions, $$ \\sqrt{n} \\Big( V^{HAC} _ {k,h} \\Big)(\\hat \\beta - \\beta_0) \\overset{d}{\\to} F $$\nThe asymptotic critical values of the $F$ statistic depend on the choice of the kernel. In order to do hypothesis testing, Kiefer and Vogelsang(2005) provide critical value functions for the t-statistic for each kernel-confidence level combination using a cubic equation: $$ cv(b) = a_0 + a_1 b + a_2 b^2 + a_3 b^3 $$\nExample Example for the Bartlett kernel:\nFixed G Asymptotics [Bester, 2013]: “Cluster covariance estimators are routinely used with data that has a group structure with independence assumed across groups. Typically, inference is conducted in such settings under the assumption that there are a large number of these independent groups.””\n“However, with enough weakly dependent data, we show that groups can be chosen by the researcher so that group-level averages are approximately independent. Intuitively, if groups are large enough and well shaped (e.g. do not have gaps), the majority of points in a group will be far from other groups, and hence approximately independent of observations from other groups provided the data are weakly dependent. The key prerequisite for our methods is the researcher’s ability to construct groups whose averages are approximately independent. As we show later, this often requires that the number of groups be kept relatively small, which is why our main results explicitly consider a fixed (small) number of groups.””\nAssumption Assumption Suppose you have data $D = (y _ {it} , x _ {it}) _ {i=1, t=1}^{N, T}$ where $y _ {it} = x _ {it}' \\beta + \\alpha_i + \\varepsilon _ {it}$ where $i$ indexes the observational unit and $t$ indexes time (could also be space).\nLet $$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; \\tilde{y} _ {it} = y _ {it} - \\frac{1}{T} \\sum _ {t=1}^T y _ {it} \\newline \u0026amp; \\tilde{x} _ {it} = x _ {it} - \\frac{1}{T} \\sum _ {t=1}^T x _ {it} \\newline \u0026amp; \\tilde{\\varepsilon} _ {it} = \\varepsilon _ {it} - \\frac{1}{T} \\sum _ {t=1}^T \\varepsilon _ {it} \\end{aligned} $$ Then $$ \\tilde{y} _ {it} = \\tilde{x} _ {it}' \\beta + \\tilde{\\varepsilon} _ {it} $$\nThe $\\tilde{\\varepsilon} _ {it}$ are by construction correlated between each other even if the original $\\varepsilon$ was iid. The cluster score variance estimator is given by: $$ \\hat{\\Omega}^{CL} = \\frac{1}{T-1} \\sum _ {i=1}^n \\sum _ {t=1}^T \\sum _ {s=1}^T \\tilde{x} _ {it} \\hat{\\tilde{\\varepsilon}} _ {it} \\tilde{x} _ {is} \\hat{\\tilde{\\varepsilon}} _ {is} $$\n It’s very similar too the HAC estimator since we have dependent cross-products here as well. However, here we do not consider the $i \\times j$ cross-products. We only have time-dependency (state).\n Comments (1) On $T$ and $n$:\n If $T$ is fixed and $n \\to \\infty$, then the number of cross-products considered is much smaller than the total number of cross-products. If $T \u0026raquo; n$ issues arise since the number of cross products considered is close to the total number of cross products. As in HAC estimation, this is a problem because it implies that the algebraic estimate of the cluster score variance gets close to zero because of the orthogonality property of the residuals. The panel assumption is that observations across individuals are not correlated.   Strategy: as in HAC, we want to limit the correlation across clusters (individuals). We hope that observations are negligibly dependent between cluster sufficiently distant from each other.\n Comments (2) Classical cluster robust estimator: $$ \\hat{\\Omega}^{CL} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^n x_i \\varepsilon_i x_j' \\varepsilon_j' \\mathbb{I} \\lbrace i,j \\text{ in the same cluster} \\rbrace $$\n On clusters:\n If the number of observations near a boundary is small relative to the sample size, ignoring the dependence should not affect inference too adversely. The higher the dimension of the data, the easier it is to have observations near boundaries (curse of dimensionality). We would like to have few clusters in order to make less independence assumptions. However, few clusters means bigger blocks and hence a larger number of cross-products to estimate. If the number of cross-products is too large (relative to the sample size), $\\hat{\\Omega}^{CL}$ does not converge   Theorem: Under regularity conditions: $$ \\hat{t} \\overset{d}{\\to} \\sqrt{\\frac{G}{G-1}} t _ {G-1} $$\nCode - DGP This code draws 100 observations from the model $y = 2 x_1 - x_2 + \\varepsilon$ where $x_1, x_2 \\sim U[0,1]$ and $\\varepsilon \\sim N(0,1)$.\n# Set seed Random.seed!(123); # Set the number of observations n = 100; # Set the dimension of X k = 2; # Draw a sample of explanatory variables X = rand(Uniform(0,1), n, k); # Draw the error term σ = 1; ε = rand(Normal(0,1), n, 1) * sqrt(σ); # Set the parameters β = [2; -1]; # Calculate the dependent variable y = X*β + ε;  Ideal Estimate # OLS estimator β_hat = (X'*X)\\(X'*y); # Residuals ε_hat = y - X*β_hat; # Homoskedastic standard errors std_h = var(ε_hat) * inv(X'*X); # Projection matrix P = X * inv(X'*X) * X'; # Leverage h = diag(P);  HC Estimates # HC0 variance and standard errors Ω_hc0 = X' * (I(n) .* ε_hat.^2) * X; std_hc0 = sqrt.(diag(inv(X'*X) * Ω_hc0 * inv(X'*X)))  ## 2-element Array{Float64,1}: ## 0.24691300271914793 ## 0.28044707935951835  # HC1 variance and standard errors Ω_hc1 = n/(n-k) * X' * (I(n) .* ε_hat.^2) * X; std_hc1 = sqrt.(diag(inv(X'*X) * Ω_hc1 * inv(X'*X)))  ## 2-element Array{Float64,1}: ## 0.24941979797977423 ## 0.2832943308272532  # HC2 variance and standard errors Ω_hc2 = X' * (I(n) .* ε_hat.^2 ./ (1 .- h)) * X; std_hc2 = sqrt.(diag(inv(X'*X) * Ω_hc2 * inv(X'*X)))  ## 2-element Array{Float64,1}: ## 0.2506509902982869 ## 0.2850878737103963  # HC3 variance and standard errors Ω_hc3 = X' * (I(n) .* ε_hat.^2 ./ (1 .- h).^2) * X; std_hc3 = sqrt.(diag(inv(X'*X) * Ω_hc3 * inv(X'*X)))  ## 2-element Array{Float64,1}: ## 0.25446321015850176 ## 0.2898264779289438  # Note what happens if you allow for full autocorrelation omega_full = X'*ε_hat*ε_hat'*X;  Inference Hypothesis Testing In order to do inference on $\\hat \\beta$ we need to know its distribution. We have two options: (i) assume gaussian error term (extended GM) or (ii) rely on asymptotic approximations (CLT).\nA statistical hypothesis is a subset of a statistical model, $\\mathcal K \\subset \\mathcal F$. A hypothesis test is a map $\\mathcal D \\rightarrow \\lbrace 0,1 \\rbrace$, $D \\mapsto T$. If $\\mathcal F$ is the statistical model and $\\mathcal K$ is the statistical hypothesis, we use the notation $H_0: \\Pr \\in \\mathcal K$.\n Generally, we are interested in understanding whether it is likely that data $D$ are drawn from $\\mathcal K$ or not.\n A hypothesis test, $T$ is our tool for deciding whether the hypothesis is consistent with the data. $T(D)= 0$ implies fail to reject $H_0$ and test inconclusive $T(D)=1$ $\\implies$ reject $H_0$ and $D$ is inconsistent with any $\\Pr \\in \\mathcal K$.\nLet $\\mathcal K \\subseteq \\mathcal F$ be a statistical hypothesis and $T$ a hypothesis test.\n Suppose $\\Pr \\in \\mathcal K$. A Type I error (relative to $\\Pr$) is an event $T(D)=1$ under $\\Pr$. Suppose $\\Pr \\in \\mathcal K^c$. A Type II error (relative to $\\Pr$) is an event $T(D)=0$ under $\\Pr$.  The corresponding probability of a type I error is called size. The corresponding probability of a type II error is called power (against the alternative $\\Pr$).\nIn this section, we are interested in testing three hypotheses, under the assumptions of linearity, strict exogeneity, no multicollinearity, normality on the error term. They are:\n $H_0: \\beta _ {0k} = \\bar \\beta _ {0k}$ (single coefficient, $\\bar \\beta _ {0k} \\in \\mathbb R$, $k \\leq K$) $a' \\beta_0 = c$ (linear combination, $a \\in \\mathbb R^K, c \\in \\mathbb R$) $R \\beta_0 = r$ (linear restrictions, $R \\in \\mathbb R^{p \\times K}$, full rank, $r \\in \\mathbb R^p$)  Testing Problem Consider the testing problem $H_0: \\beta _ {0k} = \\bar \\beta _ {0k}$ where $\\bar \\beta _ {0k}$ is a pre-specified value under the null.

The test can be one sided or two sided. The above sampling distribution can be used to construct a confidence interval.\nExample We want to asses whether or not the ``true” coefficient $\\beta_0$ equals a specific value $\\hat \\beta$. Specifically, we are interested in testing $H_0$ against $H_1$, where:\n Null Hypothesis: $H_0: \\beta_0 = \\hat \\beta$ Alternative Hypothesis: $H_1: \\beta_0 \\ne \\hat \\beta$.  Hence, we are interested in a statistic informative about $H_1$, which is the Wald test statistic $$ |T^*| = \\bigg| \\frac{\\hat \\beta - \\beta_0}{\\sigma(\\hat \\beta)}\\bigg| \\sim N(0,1) $$\nHowever, the true variance $\\sigma^2(\\hat \\beta )$ is not known and has to be estimated. Therefore we plug in the sample variance $\\hat \\sigma^2(\\hat \\beta) = \\frac{n}{n-1} \\mathbb E_n[\\hat e_i^2]$ and we use $$ |T| = \\bigg| \\frac{\\hat \\beta - \\beta_0}{\\hat \\sigma (\\hat \\beta)}\\bigg| \\sim t _ {(n-k)} $$\nComments Hypothesis testing is like proof by contradiction. Imagine the sampling distribution was generated by $\\beta$. If it is highly improbable to observe $\\hat \\beta$ given $\\beta_0 = \\beta$ then we reject the hypothesis that the sampling distribution was generated by $\\beta$.\nThen, given a realized value of the statistic $|T|$, we take the following decision:\n Do not reject $H_0$: it is consistent with random variation under true $H_0$—i.e., $|T|$ small as it has an exact student t distribution with $(n-k)$ degree of freedom in the normal regression model. Reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$: $|T| \u0026gt; c$, with $c$ being the critical values selected to control for false rejections: $\\Pr(|t _ {n-k}| \\geq c) = \\alpha$. Moreover, you can also reject $H_0$ if the p-value $p$ is such that: $p \u0026lt; \\alpha$.  Comments (2) The probability of false rejection is decreasing in $c$, i.e. the critical value for a given significant level. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\Pr (\\text{Reject } H_0 | H_0) \u0026amp; = \\Pr (|T|\u0026gt; c | H_0 ) = \\newline \u0026amp; = \\Pr (T \u0026gt; c | H_0 ) + \\Pr (T \u0026lt; -c | H_0 ) = \\newline \u0026amp; = 1 - F(c) + F(-c) = 2(1-F(c)) \\end{aligned} $$\nExample: Consider the testing problem $H_0: a'\\beta_0=c$ where $a$ is a pre-specified linear combination under study. The t-statistic for this problem is defined by: $$ t_k:= \\frac{a\u0026rsquo;b - c}{SE(a\u0026rsquo;b)}, \\ \\ SE(a\u0026rsquo;b):= \\sqrt{s^2 a'(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}a} $$\nt Stat Theorem\nIn the testing procedure above, the sampling distribution under the null $H_0$ is given by $$ t_a|X \\sim t _ {n-K} \\quad\\text{and so} \\quad t_a \\sim t _ {n-K} $$\nLike in the previous test, $t _ {(n-K)}$ denotes the t-distribution with $(n-K)$ degress of freedom. The test can again be one sided or two sided. The above sampling distribution can be used to construct a confidence interval\nF Stat Example\nConsider the testing problem $$ H_0: R \\beta_0 = r $$ where $R \\in \\mathbb R^{p \\times k}$ is a presepecified set of linear combinations and $r \\in \\mathbb R^p$ is a restriction vector.\nThe F-statistic for this problem is given by $$ F:= \\frac{(Rb-r)'[R(X\u0026rsquo;X)R']^{-1}(Rb-r)/p }{s^2} $$\nTheorem\nFor the problem, the sampling distribution of the F-statistic under the null $H_0:$ $$ F|X \\sim F _ {p,n-K} \\ \\ \\text{and so} \\ \\ F \\sim F _ {p,n-K} $$\nThe test is intrinsically two-sided. The above sampling distribution can be used to construct a confidence interval.\nEquivalence Theorem\nConsider the testing problem $H_0: R \\beta_0 = r$ where $R \\in \\mathbb R^{p\\times K}$ is a presepecified set of linear combinations and $r \\in \\mathbb R^p$ is a restriction vector.\nConsider the restricted least squares estimator, denoted $\\hat \\beta_R$: $\\hat \\beta_R: = \\text{arg} \\min _ { \\beta: R \\beta = r } Q( \\beta)$. Let $SSR_U = Q(b), \\ \\ SSR_R=Q(\\hat \\beta_R)$. Then the $F$ statistic is numerically equivalent to the following expression: $F = \\frac{(SSR_R - SSR_U)/p}{SSR_U/(n-K)}$.\nConfidence Intervals A confidence interval at $(1-\\alpha)$ is a random set $C$ such that $$ \\Pr(\\beta_0 \\in C) \\geq 1- \\alpha $$ i.e. the probability that $C$ covers the true value $\\beta$ is fixed at $(1-\\alpha)$.\nSince $C$ is not known, it has to be estimated ($\\hat{C}$). We construct confidence intervals such that:\n they are symmetric around $\\hat \\beta$; their length is proportional to $\\sigma(\\hat \\beta) = \\sqrt{Var(\\hat \\beta)}$.  A CI is equivalent to the set of parameter values such that the t-statistic is less than $c$, i.e., $$ \\hat{C} = \\bigg\\lbrace \\beta: |T(\\beta) | \\leq c \\bigg\\rbrace = \\bigg\\lbrace \\beta: - c\\leq \\frac{\\beta - \\hat \\beta}{\\sigma(\\hat \\beta)} \\leq c \\bigg\\rbrace $$\nIn practice, to construct a 95% confidence interval for a single coefficient estimate $\\hat \\beta_j$, we use the fact that $$ \\Pr \\left( \\frac{| \\hat \\beta_j - \\beta _ {0,j} |}{ \\sqrt{\\sigma^2 [(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}] _ {jj} }} \u0026gt; 1.96 \\right) = 0.05 $$\nCode # t-test for beta=0 t = abs.(β_hat ./ (std_hc1)); # p-value p_val = 1 .- cdf.(Normal(0,1), t); # F statistic of joint significance SSR_u = ε_hat'*ε_hat; SSR_r = y'*y; F = (SSR_r - SSR_u)/k / (SSR_u/(n-k)); # 95# confidente intervals conf_int = [β_hat - 1.96*std_hc1, β_hat + 1.96*std_hc1];  ","date":1635465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635465600,"objectID":"3a3dba8681825325823978a98a7af4ac","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/metrics/06_ols_inference/","publishdate":"2021-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/metrics/06_ols_inference/","section":"course","summary":"Asymptotic Theory of the OLS Estimator OLS Consistency Theorem: Assume that $(x_i, y_i) _ {i=1}^n$ i.i.d. , $\\mathbb E[x_i x_i'] = Q$ positive definite, $\\mathbb E[x_i x_i'] \u0026lt; \\infty$ and $\\mathbb E [y_i^2] \u0026lt; \\infty$, then $\\hat \\beta _ {OLS}$ is a consistent estimator of $\\beta_0$, i.","tags":null,"title":"OLS Inference","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"import os import re import time import requests import pandas as pd from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from pprint import pprint from selenium import webdriver  There is no silver bullet to getting info from the internet. The coding requirements in these notes start easy and will gradually become more demanding. We will cover the following web scraping techniques:\n Pandas APIs Scraping static webpages with BeautifulSoup Scraping dynamic wepages with Selenium  Pandas The Pandas library has a very useful webscraping command: read_html. The read_html command works for webpages that contain tables that are particularly well behaved. Let\u0026rsquo;s see an example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)\nAt first glance, it seems that there are three tables in this Wikipedia page:\n data from the IMF data from the World Bank data from the UN  Let\u0026rsquo;s see which tables pandas recognizes.\n# Scrape all tables from Wikipedia page url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)' df_list = pd.read_html(url) # Check number of tables on the page print(len(df_list))  7  Apparently Pandas has found 10 tables in this webpage. Let\u0026rsquo;s see what is their content.\n# Check headers of each table for df in df_list: print(df.shape)  (1, 1) (1, 3) (216, 9) (9, 2) (7, 2) (13, 2) (2, 2)  It seems that pandas has found many more tables that we could see. The ones that are of interest to us are probably the 3rd, 4th and 5th. But that are the others? Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the them.\n# Check first df_list[0].head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  0     0 Largest economies by nominal GDP in 2021[1]     # Check second df_list[1].head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  0 1 2     0 .mw-parser-output .legend{page-break-inside:av... $750 billion – $1 trillion $500–50 billion $25... $50–100 billion $25–50 billion $5–25 billion \u0026lt;...

A part from the footnotes, the table is already clean and organized.\nIf we knew the name of the table, we could directly retrieve it. However, we will see more about it in the next lecture.\nSpecific Libraries Sometimes, there are libraries that are already written down to do the scraping for you. Each one is tailored for a specific website and they are usually userwritten and prone to bugs and errors. However, they are often efficient and save you the time to worry about getting around some website-specific issues.\nOne example is the pytrends library for scraping Google Trends. Let\u0026rsquo;s first install it\npip3 install pytrends  Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it works. Imagine we want to do the following search:\n words \u0026ldquo;python\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;matlab\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;stata\u0026rdquo; the the second half of in 2019 daily in the US  We can get more details on how pytrends works here. The important thing to know is that if you query a time period of more than 200 days, Google will give you weekly results, instead of daily.\n# Pytrends search from pytrends.request import TrendReq # Set parameters words = ['python', 'matlab', 'stata'] timeframe = '2019-07-01 2019-12-31' country = 'US' # Get data pytrend = TrendReq() pytrend.build_payload(kw_list=words, timeframe=timeframe, geo=country) df_trends = pytrend.interest_over_time() # Plot trends_plot = df_trends.plot.line()  Apparently people don\u0026rsquo;t code during the weekend\u0026hellip;.\nAPIs From Wikipedia\n An application programming interface (API) is an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software.\n In practice, it means that the are some webpages that are structured not to be user-readable but to be computer-readable. Let\u0026rsquo;s see one example.\nGoogle provides many APIs for its services. However, they now all need identification, which means that you have to log in into your Google account and request an API key from there. This allows Google to monitor your behavior since the number of API requests is limited and beyond a certain treshold, one need to pay (a lot).\nThere are however some free APIs. One\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at one of these: zippopotam. Zippopotam lets you retrieve location information from a zip code in the US. Other countries are supported as well.\n# Let's search the department locatiton import requests zipcode = '90210' url = 'https://api.zippopotam.us/us/'+zipcode response = requests.get(url) data = response.json() data  {'post code': '90210', 'country': 'United States', 'country abbreviation': 'US', 'places': [{'place name': 'Beverly Hills', 'longitude': '-118.4065', 'state': 'California', 'state abbreviation': 'CA', 'latitude': '34.0901'}]}  Data is in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format which is basically a nested dictionary-list format. Indeed, we see that in our case, data is a dictionary where the last elements is a list with one element - another dictionary.\n# Check type of value for d in data.values(): print(type(d)) # Check list length print(len(data['places'])) # Check type of content of list print(type(data['places'][0]))  \u0026lt;class 'str'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'str'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'str'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'list'\u0026gt; 1 \u0026lt;class 'dict'\u0026gt;  The part that could be interesting to us is contained in the places category. We can easily extract it and transform it into a dataframe.\n# Add zipcode to data data['places'][0]['zipcode'] = zipcode # Export data df = pd.DataFrame(data['places']) df   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  place name longitude state state abbreviation latitude zipcode     0 Beverly Hills -118.4065 California CA 34.0901 90210     Static Webscraping We have so far used pre-made tools in order to do web-scraping. When the website contains the data in a nice table or an API is available, we do not need to worry much and we can directly retrieve the data. However, most of web scraping is much more complicated. Data is often the product of webscraping and is not readily available. Moreover, sometimes webscraping knowledge can supplement the need to pay for an API.\nHTTP What happens when you open a page on the internet? In short, your web browser is sending a request to the website that, in turn, sends back a reply/response. The exchange of messages is complex but its core involves a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request message to a web server, followed by a HTTP response (or reply). All static webscraping is build on HTTP so let\u0026rsquo;s have a closer look.\nAn HTTP message essentially has 4 components:\n A request line A number of request headers An empty line An optional message  Example\nA request message could be\nGET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1  The response would be\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 10 Oct 2010 23:26:07 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g Last-Modified: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 22:04:35 GMT ETag: \u0026quot;45b6-834-49130cc1182c0\u0026quot; Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 12 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello, World!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  So, in this case the parts are:\n The request line  HTTP/1.1 200 OK  The request headers  Date: Sun, 10 Oct 2010 23:26:07 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g Last-Modified: Sun, 26 Sep 2010 22:04:35 GMT ETag: \u0026quot;45b6-834-49130cc1182c0\u0026quot; Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 12 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html  The empty line The optional message  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello, World!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  We are interested in the optional message, which is essentially the content of the page we want to scrape. The content is usually written in HTML which is not a proper programming language but rather a typesetting language since it is the language underlying web pages and is usually generated from other programming languages.\nRequests There are many different packages in python to send requests to a web page and read its response. The most user-friendly is the requests package. You can find plenty of useful information on the requests library on its website: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/.\nWe are now going to have a look at a simple example: http://pythonscraping.com/pages/page1.html.\n# Request a simple web page url1 = 'http://pythonscraping.com/pages/page1.html' response = requests.get(url1) print(response)  \u0026lt;Response [200]\u0026gt;  We are (hopefully) getting a \u0026lt;Response [200]\u0026gt; message. In short, what we got is the status code of the request we sent to the website. The status code is a 3-digit code and essentially there are two broad categories of status codes:\n 2XX: success 4XX, 5XX: failure  It can be useful to know this codes as they are a fast way to check whether your request has failed or not. When webscraping the most common reasons you get an error are\n The link does not exist: wither the link is old/expired or you misspelled it and hence there is no page to request You have been \u0026ldquo;caught\u0026rdquo;. This is pretty common when webscraping and happens every time you are too aggressive with your scraping. How much \u0026ldquo;aggressive\u0026rdquo; is \u0026ldquo;too agrressive\u0026rdquo; depends on the website. Usually big tech websites are particularly hard to scrape and anything that is \u0026ldquo;faster than human\u0026rdquo; gets blocked. Sometimes also slow but persistent requests get blocked as well.  We have now analyzed the response status but, what is actually the response content? Let\u0026rsquo;s inspect the response object more in detail.\n# Print response attributes dir(response)  ['__attrs__', '__bool__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__enter__', '__eq__', '__exit__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getstate__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__nonzero__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__setstate__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '_content', '_content_consumed', '_next', 'apparent_encoding', 'close', 'connection', 'content', 'cookies', 'elapsed', 'encoding', 'headers', 'history', 'is_permanent_redirect', 'is_redirect', 'iter_content', 'iter_lines', 'json', 'links', 'next', 'ok', 'raise_for_status', 'raw', 'reason', 'request', 'status_code', 'text', 'url']  We are actually interested in the text of the response.\n# Print response content response.text  '\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;A Useful Page\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;An Interesting Title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.\\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;\\n\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\\n'  This is the whole content of the table. There is a large chunk of text and other parts which look more obscure. In order to understand the structure of the page, we need to have a closer look at the language in which the webpage is written: HTML. We will do it in the next section.\nHowever, let\u0026rsquo;s first analyze the other relevant components of the response. We have already had a look at the status. Let\u0026rsquo;s inspect the headers.\n# Print response headers response.headers  {'Server': 'nginx', 'Date': 'Thu, 10 Feb 2022 11:11:41 GMT', 'Content-Type': 'text/html', 'Content-Length': '361', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'X-Accel-Version': '0.01', 'Last-Modified': 'Sat, 09 Jun 2018 19:15:58 GMT', 'ETag': '\u0026quot;234-56e3a58a63780-gzip\u0026quot;', 'Accept-Ranges': 'bytes', 'Vary': 'Accept-Encoding', 'Content-Encoding': 'gzip', 'X-Powered-By': 'PleskLin'}  From the headers we can see\n the present date the name of the server hosting the page the last time the page was modified other stuff  Let\u0026rsquo;s now look at the headers of our request.\n# Request headers def check_headers(r): test_headers = dict(zip(r.request.headers.keys(), r.request.headers.values())) pprint(test_headers) check_headers(response)  {'Accept': '*/*', 'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'User-Agent': 'python-requests/2.27.1'}  The headers of our request are pretty minimal. In order to see what normal headers look like, go to https://www.whatismybrowser.com/developers/what-http-headers-is-my-browser-sending\nNormal headers look something like:\n{'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q = 0.9, image / ' 'webp, * / *;q = 0.8', 'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br', 'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9,it-IT;q=0.8,it;q=0.7,de-DE;q=0.6,de;q=0.5', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'Host': 'www.whatismybrowser.com', 'Referer': 'http://localhost:8888/', 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) ' 'AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.88 ' 'Safari/537.36'}  The most important difference is that the requests model default User-Agent is python-requests/2.22.0 which means that we are walking around the web with a big WARNING: web scrapers sign. This is the simplest way to get caught and blocked by a website. Luckily, we can easily change our headers in order to be more subtle.\n# Change headers headers = {\u0026quot;User-Agent\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Mozilla/5.0\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Accept\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;webp, * / *;q = 0.8\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Accept-Language\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;en-US,en;q=0.9\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Accept-Encoding\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;br, gzip, deflate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Referer\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://www.google.ch/\u0026quot;} # Test if change worked response = requests.get(url1, headers=headers) check_headers(response)  {'Accept': 'webp, * / *;q = 0.8', 'Accept-Encoding': 'br, gzip, deflate', 'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'Referer': 'https://www.google.ch/', 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}  Nice! Now we are a little more stealthy.\nYou might now be asking yourself what are the ethical limits of webscraping. Information on the internet is public but scraping a website imposes a workload on the website\u0026rsquo;s server. If the website is not protected against aggressive scrapers (most websites are), your activity could significantly slower the website or even crash it.\nUsually websites include their policies for scraping in a text file named robots.txt.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the robots.txt file of http://pythonscraping.com/.\n# Read robots.txt response = requests.get('http://pythonscraping.com/robots.txt') print(response.text)  # # robots.txt # # This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts # of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo! # and Google. By telling these \u0026quot;robots\u0026quot; where not to go on your site, # you save bandwidth and server resources. # # This file will be ignored unless it is at the root of your host: # Used: http://example.com/robots.txt # Ignored: http://example.com/site/robots.txt # # For more information about the robots.txt standard, see: # http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html # # For syntax checking, see: # http://www.frobee.com/robots-txt-check User-agent: * Crawl-delay: 10 # Directories Disallow: /includes/ Disallow: /misc/ Disallow: /modules/ Disallow: /profiles/ Disallow: /scripts/ Disallow: /themes/ # Files Disallow: /CHANGELOG.txt Disallow: /cron.php Disallow: /INSTALL.mysql.txt Disallow: /INSTALL.pgsql.txt Disallow: /INSTALL.sqlite.txt Disallow: /install.php Disallow: /INSTALL.txt Disallow: /LICENSE.txt Disallow: /MAINTAINERS.txt Disallow: /update.php Disallow: /UPGRADE.txt Disallow: /xmlrpc.php # Paths (clean URLs) Disallow: /admin/ Disallow: /comment/reply/ Disallow: /filter/tips/ Disallow: /node/add/ Disallow: /search/ Disallow: /user/register/ Disallow: /user/password/ Disallow: /user/login/ Disallow: /user/logout/ # Paths (no clean URLs) Disallow: /?q=admin/ Disallow: /?q=comment/reply/ Disallow: /?q=filter/tips/ Disallow: /?q=node/add/ Disallow: /?q=search/ Disallow: /?q=user/password/ Disallow: /?q=user/register/ Disallow: /?q=user/login/ Disallow: /?q=user/logout/  As we can see, this robots.txt file mostly deals with crawlers, i.e. scripts that are designed to recover the structure of a website by exploring it. Crawlers are mostly used by browsers that want to index websites.\nNow we have explored most of the issues around HTTP requests. We can now proceed to what we are interested in: the content of the web page. In order to do that, we need to know the language in which wabpages are written: HTML.\nHTML Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\nHTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.\nTags Tags are the cues that HTML uses to surround content and provide information about its nature. There is a very large amount of tags but some of the most common are:\n \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; for head and body of the page \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; for paragraphs \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; for line breaks \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; for tables. These are the ones that pandas reads. However, we have seen that not all elements that look like tables are actually \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; and viceversa. Table elements are tagged as \u0026lt;th\u0026gt; (table header), \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; (table row) and \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; (table data: a cell) \u0026lt;img\u0026gt; for images \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; for headers (titles and subtitles) \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; dor divisions, i.e. for grouping elements \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; for hyperlinks \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;ol\u0026gt; for unordered and ordered lists where list elements are tagged as \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;  Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the previous page\n# Inspect HTML response.text  '#\\n# robots.txt\\n#\\n# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts\\n# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo!\\n# and Google.

It\u0026rsquo;s the parser. In short, there are often small mistakes/variations in HTML and each parser interprets it differently. In principles, the latest HTML standard is HTML5, therefore the html5lib parser should be the most \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo; parser. It might happen that the same code does not work for another person if you use a different parser.\nThis is much better but it can be improved.\n# Prettify response print(soup.prettify())  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; # # robots.txt # # This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts # of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo! # and Google.

Now the tree structure of the HTML page is clearly visible and we can visually separate the different elements.\nIn particular, the structure of the page is:\n page head  with ttle: \u0026ldquo;A Useful Page\u0026rdquo;   page body  with level 1 header \u0026ldquo;An Interesting Title\u0026rdquo; a division with text \u0026ldquo;Lorem ipsum\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;    How do we work with these elements? Suppose we want to recover the title and the text. The requests library has some useful functions.\n# Find the title url = 'http://pythonscraping.com/pages/page1.html' response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml') soup.find('title')  \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;A Useful Page\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;  # Extract text soup.find('title').text  'A Useful Page'  # Find all h1 elements soup.find_all('h1')  [\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;An Interesting Title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;]  # Find all title or h1 elements soup.find_all(['title','h1'])  [\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;A Useful Page\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;An Interesting Title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;]  Regular Expressions Note that there is always a more direct alternative: using regular expressions directly on the response!\n# Find the title re.findall('\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;(.*)\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;', response.text)[0]  'A Useful Page'  # Find all h1 elements re.findall('\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;(.*)\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;', response.text)  ['An Interesting Title']  # Find all title or h1 elements [x[1] for x in re.findall('\u0026lt;(title|h1)\u0026gt;(.*)\u0026lt;', response.text)]  ['A Useful Page', 'An Interesting Title']  This was a very simple page and there was not so much to look for. Let\u0026rsquo;s now look at a more realistic example.\nAttributes Let\u0026rsquo;s inspect a slightly more complicated page: http://pythonscraping.com/pages/page3.html.\nIn this page, there is much more content than in the previous one. There seems to be a table, there are images, hyperlinks, etc\u0026hellip; It\u0026rsquo;s the perfect playground. Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at what does the HTML code look like.\n# Inspect HTML code url2 = 'http://pythonscraping.com/pages/page3.html' response = requests.get(url2) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text,'lxml') print(soup.prettify())  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; img{ width:75px; } table{ width:50%; } td{ margin:10px; padding:10px; } .wrapper{ width:800px; } .excitingNote{ font-style:italic; font-weight:bold; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;wrapper\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;../img/gifts/logo.jpg\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;float:left;\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; Totally Normal Gifts \u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;content\u0026quot;\u0026gt; Here is a collection of totally normal, totally reasonable gifts that your friends are sure to love!

An important distintion is that now some tags have classes. For example, the first \u0026lt;img\u0026gt; tag now has a class src and a class style.\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;../img/gifts/logo.jpg\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;float:left;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  Moreover, even though BeautifulSoup is formatting the page in a nicer way, it\u0026rsquo;s still pretty hard to go through it. How can one locate one specific element? And, most importantly, if you know the element only graphically, how do you recover the equivalent in the HTML code?\nThe best way is to use the inspect function from Chrome. Firefox has an equivalent function. Let\u0026rsquo;s inspect the original page.\n Suppose now you want to recover all item names. Let\u0026rsquo;s inspect the first. The corresponding line looks like this:\n \u0026lt;tr class=\u0026quot;gift\u0026quot; id=\u0026quot;gift1\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; Vegetable Basket \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; This vegetable basket is the perfect gift for your health conscious (or overweight) friends! \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;excitingNote\u0026quot;\u0026gt; Now with super-colorful bell peppers! \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; $15.00 \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt;  Let\u0026rsquo;s see some alternative ways.\n# Select the first td element soup.find('td')  \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; Vegetable Basket \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;  # Select the first td element of the second tr element (row) second_row = soup.find_all('tr')[1] second_row.find('td')  \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; Vegetable Basket \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;  # Select the first element of the table with id=\u0026quot;giftList\u0026quot; table = soup.find('table', {\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;giftList\u0026quot;}) table.find('td')  \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; Vegetable Basket \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;  The last is the most robust way to scrape. In fact, the first two methods are likely to fail if the page gets modified. If another td element gets added on top of the table, the code will recover something else entirely. In general it\u0026rsquo;s a good practice, to look if the element we want to scrape can be identified by some attribute that is likely to be invariant to changes to other parts of the web page. In this case, the table with id=\u0026quot;giftList\u0026quot; is likely to be our object of interest even if another table id added, for example.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say no we want to recover the whole table.

Let\u0026rsquo;s proceed with a practical example.\nCSS Selectors One alternative way of doing exactly the same thing is to use select. The select function is very similar to find_all but has a different syntax. In particular, to search an element with a certain tag and  attribute, we have to pass the following input:\nsoup.select(tag[attribute=\u0026quot;attribute_name\u0026quot;])  # Select the first element of the table whose id contains \u0026quot;List\u0026quot; table = soup.select('table[id*=\u0026quot;List\u0026quot;]')[0] table.find('td')  \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; Vegetable Basket \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;  Forms and post requests When you are scraping, you sometimes have to fill-in forms, either to log-in into an account, or to input the arguments for a search query. Often forms are dynamic objects, but not always. Sometimes we can fill in forms also using the requests library. In whis section we see a simple example.\nShortcut Often we can bypass forms, if the form redirects us to another page whose URL contains the parameters of the form. These are \u0026ldquo;well-behaved\u0026rdquo; forms and are actually quite frequent.\nWe can find a simple example at: http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/. This form takes as input a bunch of information and when we click on \u0026ldquo;Submit my information\u0026rdquo;, we get exactly the same page but with a different URL that contains the information we have inserted.\nSuppose I insert the following information:\n Your gender: \u0026ldquo;Male\u0026rdquo; Food you like: \u0026ldquo;Pizza!\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Fries please\u0026rdquo;  We should get the following url: http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?name=\u0026gender=M\u0026pizza=like\u0026fries=like\u0026haircolor=black\u0026comments=\nWe can decompose the url in various components, separated by one \u0026ldquo;?\u0026rdquo; and multiple \u0026ldquo;\u0026amp;\u0026quot;:\n http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/ name= gender=M pizza=like fries=like haircolor=black comments=  We can clearly see a pattern: the first component is the cose of the url and the other components are the form options. The ones we didn\u0026rsquo;t fill have the form option= while the ones we did fill are option=value. Knowing the syntax of a particular form we could fill it ourselves.\nFor example, we could remove the fries and change the hair color to brown: http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?name=\u0026gender=M\u0026pizza=like\u0026fries=\u0026haircolor=brown\u0026comments=\nMoreover, most forms work even if you remove the empty options. For example, the url above is equivalent to:http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?gender=M\u0026amp;pizza=like\u0026amp;haircolor=brown\u0026amp;comments=\nOne way to scrape websites with such forms is to create a string with the url with all the empty options and fill them using string formatting functions.\n# Building form url url_core = 'http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?' url_options = 'name=%s\u0026amp;gender=%s\u0026amp;pizza=%s\u0026amp;fries=%s\u0026amp;haircolor=%s\u0026amp;comments=%s' options = ('','M','like','','brown','') url = url_core + url_options % options print(url)  http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?name=\u0026amp;gender=M\u0026amp;pizza=like\u0026amp;fries=\u0026amp;haircolor=brown\u0026amp;comments=  An alternative way is to name the options. This alternative is more verbose but more precise and does not require you to provide always all the options, even if empty.\n# Alternative 1 url_core = 'http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?' url_options = 'name={name}\u0026amp;gender={gender}\u0026amp;pizza={pizza}\u0026amp;fries={fries}\u0026amp;haircolor={haircolor}\u0026amp;comments={comments}' options = { 'name': '', 'gender': 'M', 'pizza': 'like', 'fries': '', 'haircolor': 'brown', 'comments': '' } url = url_core + url_options.format(**options) print(url)  http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?name=\u0026amp;gender=M\u0026amp;pizza=like\u0026amp;fries=\u0026amp;haircolor=brown\u0026amp;comments=  Lastly, one could build the url on the go.\n# Alternative 2 url = 'http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?' options = { 'gender': 'M', 'pizza': 'like', 'haircolor': 'brown', } for key, value in options.items(): url += key + '=' + value + '\u0026amp;' print(url)  http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/basicform/?gender=M\u0026amp;pizza=like\u0026amp;haircolor=brown\u0026amp;  Post forms Sometimes however, forms do not provide nice URLs as output. This is particularly true for login forms. There is however still a method, for some of them, to deal with them.\nFor this section, we will use the same form example as before: http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/postform2/.\nThis looks like the same form but now when the user clicks on \u0026ldquo;Submit my information\u0026rdquo;, we get a page with a summary of the information. The biggest difference however, is that the output URL is exactly the same. Hence, we cannot rely on the same URL-bulding strategy as before.\nIf we inspect the page, we observe the following line at the very beginning\n\u0026lt;form method=\u0026quot;POST\u0026quot;\u0026gt; [...] \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt;  And inside there are various input fields:\n \u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;text\u0026quot;\u0026gt; for name \u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;radio\u0026quot;\u0026gt; for gender \u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;checkbox\u0026quot;\u0026gt; for food \u0026lt;select\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/select\u0026gt; for the hair color \u0026lt;textarea\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/textarea\u0026gt; for comments  These are all fields with which we can interact using the response package. The main difference is that we won\u0026rsquo;t use the get method to get the response from the URL but we will use the post method to post our form parameters and get a response.\nIf we input the following options:\n gender: male pizza: yes hair color: brown hair  and we click \u0026ldquo;Submit my information\u0026rdquo; we get to a page with the following text:\nThanks for submitting your information Here's a dump of the form data that was submitted: array(5) { [\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(0) \u0026quot;\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;gender\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(1) \u0026quot;M\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;pizza\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(4) \u0026quot;like\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;haircolor\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(5) \u0026quot;brown\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;comments\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(0) \u0026quot;\u0026quot; }  We will not try to get to the same page using the requests package.\n# URL url = 'http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/postform2/' # Options options = { 'gender': 'M', 'pizza': 'like', 'haircolor': 'brown', } # Post request response = requests.post(url, data=options) print(response.text)  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Thanks for submitting your information\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here's a dump of the form data that was submitted:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;array(3) { [\u0026quot;gender\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(1) \u0026quot;M\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;pizza\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(4) \u0026quot;like\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;haircolor\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(5) \u0026quot;brown\u0026quot; } \u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  We have obtained exactly what we wanted! However, sometimes, websites block direct post requests.\nOne simple example is: http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/postform3/.\n# Post request url = 'http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/postform3/' response = requests.post(url, data=options) print(response.text)  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; Are you trying to submit information from somewhere else? \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  What happened? If we inspect the page, we can see that there is a new line at the beginning:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot; name=\u0026quot;protection\u0026quot; value=\u0026quot;2c17abf5d5b4e326bea802600ff88405\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  Now the form contains one more value - protection which is conventiently hidden. In order to bypass the protection, we need to provide the correct protection value to the form.\n# Post request url = 'http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/postform3/' response = requests.get(url) # Get out the value for protection soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml') options['protection'] = soup.find('input', attrs={'name': 'protection'}).get('value') # Post request response = requests.post(url, data=options) print(response.text)  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Thanks for submitting your information\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here's a dump of the form data that was submitted:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;array(4) { [\u0026quot;gender\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(1) \u0026quot;M\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;pizza\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(4) \u0026quot;like\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;haircolor\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(5) \u0026quot;brown\u0026quot; [\u0026quot;protection\u0026quot;]=\u0026gt; string(32) \u0026quot;16c87fc858e4d9fcb8d9c920b699388d\u0026quot; } \u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  Indeed, now the post request was successful.\nProxies We have discussed at the beginning how to be more subtle while scraping, by changing headers. In this section we will explore one step forward in anonimity: proxies.\nWhen we send an HTTP request, first the request is sent to a proxy server. The important thing is that the destination web server will which is the origin proxy server. Therefore, when one destination web server sees too many requests coming from one machine, it will block the proxy server.\nHow can we change proxy? There are many websites that offer proxies for money but there are also some that offer proxies for free. The problem with free proxies (but often also with premium ones) is that there are many users using the same proxy, hence they are\n slow blocked fast by many websites  Nevertheless, it might be still useful to know how to change proxies.\nGet proxy list One website where we can get some free proxies to use for scraping is https://free-proxy-list.net/.\nIf we open the page, we see that there is a long list of proxies, from different countries and with different characteristics. Importantly, we are mostly interested in https proxies. We are now going to retrieve a list of them. Note that the proxy list of this website is updated quite often. However, free proxies usually \u0026ldquo;expire\u0026rdquo; even faster.\n# Retrieve proxy list def get_proxies(): response = requests.get('https://free-proxy-list.net/') soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'lxml') table = soup.find('table', {'class':'table'}) proxies = [] rows = table.find_all('tr') for row in rows: cols = row.find_all('td') if len(cols)\u0026gt;0: line = [col.text for col in cols] if line[6]=='yes': proxies += [line[0]+':'+line[1]] return proxies len(get_proxies())  176  We have found many proxies. How do we use them? We have to provide them as an argment to a requests session.\n# Test proxies url = 'https://www.google.com' proxies = get_proxies() for proxy in proxies[:10]: try: response = session.get(url, proxies={\u0026quot;https\u0026quot;: proxy}, timeout=5) print(response) except Exception as e: print(type(e))  \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'NameError'\u0026gt;  Yes, most proxies were extremely slow (and consider we are opening Google\u0026hellip;) and we got a ConnetTimeout error. Other proxies worked and for one or two of the others we might have got a ProxyError.\nDynamic Webscraping Let\u0026rsquo;s try to scrape the quotes from this link: http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/simplejavascript/. It seems like a straightforward job.\n# Scrape javascript page url = 'http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/simplejavascript/' response = requests.get(url) print(response.text)  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; $(function() { document.cookie = \u0026quot;jsenabled=1\u0026quot;; $.getJSON(\u0026quot;quotes.php\u0026quot;, function(data) { var items = []; $.each(data, function(key, val) { items.push(\u0026quot;\u0026lt;li id='\u0026quot; + key + \u0026quot;'\u0026gt;\u0026quot; + val + \u0026quot;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026quot;); }); $(\u0026quot;\u0026lt;ul/\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, { html: items.join(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) }).appendTo(\u0026quot;body\u0026quot;); }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Here are some quotes\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;  Weird. Our response does not contain the quotes on the page, even though they are clearly visible when we open it in our browser.\nSelenium Selenium is a python library that emulates a browser and lets us see pages exactly as with a normal browser. This is the most user-friendly way to do web scraping, however it has a huge cost: speed. This is by far the slowest way to do web scraping.\nAfter installing selenium, we need to download a browser to simulate. We will use Google\u0026rsquo;s chromedriver. You can download it from here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/. Make sure to select \u0026ldquo;latest stable release\u0026rdquo; and not \u0026ldquo;latest beta release\u0026rdquo;.\nMove the downloaded chromedriver in the current directory (\u0026quot;/11-python-webscraping\u0026rdquo; for me). We will now try open the url above with selenium and see if we can scrape the quotes in it.\n# Set your chromedriver name chromedriver_name = '/chromedriver_mac'  # Open url path = os.getcwd() print(path) driver = webdriver.Chrome(path+chromedriver_name)  /Users/mcourt/Dropbox/Projects/Data-Science-Python/notebooks /var/folders/xy/szm3b7211cj16ldwcywbvfzdqv7yhd/T/ipykernel_92159/2846782857.py:4: DeprecationWarning: executable_path has been deprecated, please pass in a Service object driver = webdriver.Chrome(path+chromedriver_name)  Awesome! Now, if everything went smooth, you should have a new Chrome window with a banner that says \u0026ldquo;Chrome is being controlled by automated test software\u0026rdquo;. We can now open the web page and check that the list appears.\n# Open url url = 'http://www.webscrapingfordatascience.com/simplejavascript/' driver.get(url)  Again, if averything went well, we are now abl to see our page with all the quotes in it. How do we scrape them?\nIf we inspect the elements of the list with the right-click inspect option, we should see something like:\n\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script src=\u0026quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; $(function() { document.cookie = \u0026quot;jsenabled=1\u0026quot;; $.getJSON(\u0026quot;quotes.php\u0026quot;, function(data) { var items = []; $.each(data, function(key, val) { items.push(\u0026quot;\u0026lt;li id='\u0026quot; + key + \u0026quot;'\u0026gt;\u0026quot; + val + \u0026quot;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026quot;); }); $(\u0026quot;\u0026lt;ul/\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, { html: items.join(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) }).appendTo(\u0026quot;body\u0026quot;); }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Here are some quotes\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li id=\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Every strike brings me closer to the next home run. –Babe Ruth\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li id=\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;\u0026gt;The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why. –Mark Twain\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li id=\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it.

Can we actually retrieve it? Let\u0026rsquo;s try.\nThe most common selenium functions to get elements of a page, have a very intuitive syntax and are: find_element_by_id\n find_element_by_name find_element_by_xpath find_element_by_link_text find_element_by_partial_link_text find_element_by_tag_name find_element_by_class_name find_element_by_css_selector  We will not try to recover all elements with tag \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; (element of list \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;).\n# Scrape content quotes = [li.text for li in driver.find_elements_by_tag_name('li')] quotes  /var/folders/xy/szm3b7211cj16ldwcywbvfzdqv7yhd/T/ipykernel_92159/157107938.py:2: DeprecationWarning: find_elements_by_* commands are deprecated.

Why?\nThe problem is that we are trying to retrieve the content of the page too fast. The page hasn\u0026rsquo;t loaded yet. This is a common issue with selenium. Where are two ways to solve it:\n waiting waiting for the element to load  The second way is the best way but we will first try the first and simpler one: we will just ask the browser to wait for 1 second before searching for \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; tags\n# Scraping driver = webdriver.Chrome(path+chromedriver_name, options=headless_option) driver.get(url) time.sleep(1) quotes = [li.text for li in driver.find_elements_by_tag_name('li')] quotes  /var/folders/xy/szm3b7211cj16ldwcywbvfzdqv7yhd/T/ipykernel_92159/2964398594.py:2: DeprecationWarning: executable_path has been deprecated, please pass in a Service object driver = webdriver.Chrome(path+chromedriver_name, options=headless_option) /var/folders/xy/szm3b7211cj16ldwcywbvfzdqv7yhd/T/ipykernel_92159/2964398594.py:5: DeprecationWarning: find_elements_by_* commands are deprecated.

If it didn\u0026rsquo;t work, just increase the waiting time and it should work.\nWe can now have a look at the \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; way to use a series of built-in functions:\n WebDriverWait: the waiting function. We will call the until method expected_conditions: the condition function. We will call the visibility_of_all_elements_located method By: the selector function.

In order to make a prediction for a given observation, we typically use the mean or the mode of the training observations in the region to which it belongs. Since the set of splitting rules used to segment the predictor space can be summarized in a tree, these types of approaches are known as decision tree methods.\nRegression Trees For this session we will consider the Hitters dataset. It consists in individual level data of baseball players. In our applications, we are interested in predicting the players Salary.\n# Load the data hitters = pd.read_csv('data/Hitters.csv').dropna() hitters.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Unnamed: 0 AtBat Hits HmRun Runs RBI Walks Years CAtBat CHits ...

We fit a regression three with 3 leaves or, equivalently put, 2 nodes.\n# Fit regression tree tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=3) tree.fit(X, y)  DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=3)  We are now going to plot the results visually. The biggest avantage of trees is interpretability.\n# Figure 8.1 fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1) ax.set_title('Figure 8.1'); # Plot tree plot_tree(tree, filled=True, feature_names=features, fontsize=14, ax=ax);  The tree consists of a series of splitting rules, starting at the top of the tree. The top split assigns observations having Years\u0026lt;4.5 to the left branch.1 The predicted salary for these players is given by the mean response value for the players in the data set with Years\u0026lt;4.5. For such players, the mean log salary is 5.107, and so we make a prediction of 5.107 thousands of dollars, i.e. $165,174, for these players. Players with Years\u0026gt;=4.5 are assigned to the right branch, and then that group is further subdivided by Hits.\nOverall, the tree stratifies or segments the players into three regions of predictor space:\n players who have played for four or fewer years players who have played for five or more years and who made fewer than 118 hits last year, and players who have played for five or more years and who made at least 118 hits last year.  These three regions can be written as\n R1 = {X | Years\u0026lt;4.5} R2 = {X | Years\u0026gt;=4.5, Hits\u0026lt;117.5}, and R3 = {X | Years\u0026gt;=4.5, Hits\u0026gt;=117.5}.  Since the dimension of $X$ is 2, we can visualize the space and the regions in a 2-dimensional graph.\n# Figure 8.2 def make_figure_8_2(): # Init hitters.plot('Years', 'Hits', kind='scatter', color='orange', figsize=(7,6)) plt.title('Figure 8.2') plt.xlim(0,25); plt.ylim(ymin=-5); plt.xticks([1, 4.5, 24]); plt.yticks([1, 117.5, 238]); # Split lines plt.vlines(4.5, ymin=-5, ymax=250, color='g') plt.hlines(117.5, xmin=4.5, xmax=25, color='g') # Regions plt.annotate('R1', xy=(2,117.5), fontsize='xx-large') plt.annotate('R2', xy=(11,60), fontsize='xx-large') plt.annotate('R3', xy=(11,170), fontsize='xx-large');  make_figure_8_2()  We might interpret the above regression tree as follows: Years is the most important factor in determining Salary, and players with less experience earn lower salaries than more experienced players. Given that a player is less experienced, the number of hits that he made in the previous year seems to play little role in his salary. But among players who have been in the major leagues for five or more years, the number of hits made in the previous year does affect salary, and players who made more hits last year tend to have higher salaries.\nBuilding a Tree There are two main steps in the construction of a tree:\n We divide the predictor space—that is, the set of possible values for $X_1, X_2, \u0026hellip; , X_p$ into $J$ distinct and non-overlapping regions, $R_1,R_2,\u0026hellip;,R_J$. For every observation that falls into the region $R_j$ , we make the same prediction, which is simply the mean of the response values for the training observations in $R_j$.  The second step is easy. But how does one construct the regions? Our purpose is to minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals, across the different regions:\n$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{J} \\sum_{i \\in R_{j}}\\left(y_{i}-\\hat{y}{R{j}}\\right)^{2} $$\nUnfortunately, it is computationally infeasible to consider every possible partition of the feature space into $J$ boxes.\nFor this reason, we take a top-down, greedy approach that is known as recursive binary splitting. The approach is top-down because it begins at the top of the tree (at which point all observations belong to a single region) and then successively splits the predictor space; each split is indicated via two new branches further down on the tree. It is greedy because at each step of the tree-building process, the best split is made at that particular step, rather than looking ahead and picking a split that will lead to a better tree in some future step.\nIn practice, the method is the following:\n we select the predictor $X_j$ we select the cutpoint $s$ such that splitting the predictor space into the regions ${X|X_j \u0026lt; s}$ and ${X|X_j \\geq s}$ leads to the greatest possible reduction in RSS we repeat (1)-(2) for all predictors $X_1, \u0026hellip; , X_p$, i.e. we solve  $$ \\arg \\min_{j,s} \\ \\sum_{i: x_{i} \\in {X|X_j \u0026lt; s}}\\left(y_{i}-\\hat{y}i\\right)^{2}+\\sum{i: x_{i} \\in {X|X_j \\geq s}}\\left(y_{i}-\\hat{y}_i\\right)^{2} $$\nwe choose the predictor and cutpoint such that the resulting tree has the lowest RSS we keep repeating (1)-(4) until a certain condition is met. However, after the first iteration we also have to pick which region to split which adds a further dimension to optimize over.  Let\u0026rsquo;s build our own Node class to play around with trees.\nclass Node: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Class used to represent nodes in a Regression Tree Attributes ---------- x : np.array independent variables y : np.array dependent variables idxs : np.array indexes fo x and y for current node depth : int depth of the sub-tree (default 5) Methods ------- find_next_nodes(self) Keep growing the tree find_best_split(self) Find the best split split(self) Split the tree \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; def __init__(self, x, y, idxs, depth=5): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Initialize node\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; self.x = x self.y = y self.idxs = idxs self.depth = depth self.get_next_nodes() def get_next_nodes(self): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;If the node is not terminal, get further splits\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; if self.is_last_leaf: return self.find_best_split() self.split() def find_best_split(self): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Loop over variables and their values to find the best split\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; best_score = float('inf') # Loop over variables for col in range(self.x.shape[1]): x = self.x[self.idxs, col] # Loop over all splits for s in np.unique(x): lhs = x \u0026lt;= s rhs = x \u0026gt; s curr_score = self.get_score(lhs, rhs) # If best score, save it if curr_score \u0026lt; best_score: best_score = curr_score self.split_col = col self.split_val = s return self def get_score(self, lhs, rhs): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Get score of a given split\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; y = self.y[self.idxs] lhs_mse = self.get_mse(y[lhs]) rhs_mse = self.get_mse(y[rhs]) return lhs_mse * lhs.sum() + rhs_mse * rhs.sum() def get_mse(self, y): return np.mean((y-np.mean(y))**2) def split(self): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;Split a node into 2 sub-nodes (recursive)\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; x = self.x[self.idxs, self.split_col] lhs = x \u0026lt;= self.split_val rhs = x \u0026gt; self.split_val self.lhs = Node(self.x, self.y, self.idxs[lhs], self.depth-1) self.rhs = Node(self.x, self.y, self.idxs[rhs], self.depth-1) to_print = (self.depth, self.split_col, self.split_val, sum(lhs), sum(rhs)) print('Split on layer %.0f: var%1.0f = %.4f (%.0f/%.0f)' % to_print) return self @property def is_last_leaf(self): return self.depth\u0026lt;=1  What does a Node look like?\n# Init first node tree1 = Node(X, y, np.arange(len(y)), 1) # Documentation (always comment and document your code!) print(tree1.__doc__)   Class used to represent nodes in a Regression Tree Attributes ---------- x : np.array independent variables y : np.array dependent variables idxs : np.array indexes fo x and y for current node depth : int depth of the sub-tree (default 5) Methods ------- find_next_nodes(self) Keep growing the tree find_best_split(self) Find the best split split(self) Split the tree  Which properties does it have?\n# Inspect the class dir(tree1)  ['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'depth', 'find_best_split', 'get_mse', 'get_next_nodes', 'get_score', 'idxs', 'is_last_leaf', 'split', 'x', 'y']  What is the depth?

This is because the resulting tree might be too complex. A smaller tree with fewer splits might lead to lower variance and better interpretation at the cost of a little bias.\nWe can see it happening if we build the same tree as above, but with 5 leaves.\n# Compute tree overfit_tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=5).fit(X, y)  We plot the 5-leaf tree.\n# Plot tree fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1) plot_tree(overfit_tree, filled=True, feature_names=features, fontsize=14, ax=ax);  The split on the far left is predicting a very high Salary (7.243) for players with few Years of experience and few Hits. Indeed this prediction is based on an extremely tiny subsample (2). They are probably outliers and our tree is most likely overfitting.\nOne possible alternative is to insert a minimum number of observation per leaf.\n# Compute tree no_overfit_tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=5, min_samples_leaf=10).fit(X, y) # Plot tree fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1) plot_tree(no_overfit_tree, filled=True, feature_names=features, fontsize=14, ax=ax);  Now the tree makes much more sense: the lower the Years and the Hits, the lower the predicted Salary as we can see from the shades getting darker and darker as we move left to right\nAnother possible alternative to the process described above is to build the tree only so long as the decrease in the RSS due to each split exceeds some (high) threshold.\nThis strategy will result in smaller trees, but is too short-sighted since a seemingly worthless split early on in the tree might be followed by a very good split—that is, a split that leads to a large reduction in RSS later on.\nWe can use cross-validation to pick the optimal tree length.\n# Import original split features = ['Years', 'Hits', 'RBI', 'PutOuts', 'Walks', 'Runs', 'AtBat', 'HmRun'] X_train = pd.read_csv('data/Hitters_X_train.csv').dropna()[features] X_test = pd.read_csv('data/Hitters_X_test.csv').dropna()[features] y_train = pd.read_csv('data/Hitters_y_train.csv').dropna() y_test = pd.read_csv('data/Hitters_y_test.csv').dropna()  # Init params = range(2,11) reg_scores = np.zeros((len(params),3)) best_score = 10**6 # Loop over all parameters for i,k in enumerate(params): # Model tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_leaf_nodes=k) # Loop over splits tree.fit(X_train, y_train) reg_scores[i,0] = mean_squared_error(tree.predict(X_train), y_train) reg_scores[i,1] = mean_squared_error(tree.predict(X_test), y_test) # Get CV score kf6 = KFold(n_splits=6) reg_scores[i,2] = -cross_val_score(tree, X_train, y_train, cv=kf6, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error').mean() # Save best model if reg_scores[i,2]\u0026lt;best_score: best_model = tree best_score = reg_scores[i,2]  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the optimal tree depth, using 6-fold cv.\n# Figure 8.5 def make_figure_8_5(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(16,6)) fig.suptitle('Figure 8.5') # Plot scores ax1.plot(params, reg_scores); ax1.axvline(params[np.argmin(reg_scores[:,2])], c='k', ls='--') ax1.legend(['Train','Test','6-fold CV']); ax1.set_title('Cross-Validation Scores'); # Plot best tree plot_tree(best_model, filled=True, impurity=False, feature_names=features, fontsize=12, ax=ax2); ax2.set_title('Best Model');  make_figure_8_5()  The optimal tree has 4 leaves.\nClassification Trees A classification tree is very similar to a regression tree, except that it is used to predict a qualitative response rather than a quantitative one.\nFor a classification tree, we predict that each observation belongs to the most commonly occurring class of training observations in the region to which it belongs.\nBuilding a Classification Tree The task of growing a classification tree is similar to the task of growing a regression tree. However, in the classification setting, RSS cannot be used as a criterion for making the binary splits.\nWe define $\\hat p_{mk}$ as the proportion of training observations in the $m^{th}$ region that are from the $k^{th}$ class. Possible loss functions to decide the splits are:\n Classification error rate  $$ E = 1 - \\max {k}\\left(\\hat{p}{m k}\\right) $$\n Gini index  $$ G=\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\hat{p}{m k}\\left(1-\\hat{p}{m k}\\right) $$\n Entropy  $$ D=-\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\hat{p}{m k} \\log \\hat{p}{m k} $$\nIn 2-class classification problems, this is what the different scores look like, for different proportions of class 2 ($p$), when the true proportion is $p_0 =0.5$.\nWhen building a classification tree, either the Gini index or the entropy are typically used to evaluate the quality of a particular split, since these two approaches are more sensitive to node purity than is the classification error rate.\nFor this section we will work with the Heart dataset on individual heart failures. We will try to use individual characteristics in order to predict heart deseases (HD). The varaible is binary: Yes, No.\n# Load heart dataset heart = pd.read_csv('data/Heart.csv').drop('Unnamed: 0', axis=1).dropna() heart.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Age Sex ChestPain RestBP Chol Fbs RestECG MaxHR ExAng Oldpeak Slope Ca Thal AHD     0 63 1 typical 145 233 1 2 150 0 2.3 3 0.0 fixed No   1 67 1 asymptomatic 160 286 0 2 108 1 1.5 2 3.0 normal Yes   2 67 1 asymptomatic 120 229 0 2 129 1 2.6 2 2.0 reversable Yes   3 37 1 nonanginal 130 250 0 0 187 0 3.5 3 0.0 normal No   4 41 0 nontypical 130 204 0 2 172 0 1.4 1 0.0 normal No     # Fastorize variables heart.ChestPain = pd.factorize(heart.ChestPain)[0] heart.Thal = pd.factorize(heart.Thal)[0]  # Set features features = [col for col in heart.columns if col!='AHD'] X2 = heart[features] y2 = pd.factorize(heart.AHD)[0]  We now fit our classifier.\n# Fit classification tree clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=None, max_leaf_nodes=11) clf.fit(X2,y2)  DecisionTreeClassifier(max_leaf_nodes=11)  What is the score?\n# Final score clf.score(X2,y2)  0.8686868686868687  Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the whole tree.\n# Figure 8.6 a def make_fig_8_6a(): # Init fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(16,12)) ax.set_title('Figure 8.6'); # Plot tree plot_tree(clf, filled=True, feature_names=features, class_names=['No','Yes'], fontsize=12, ax=ax);  make_fig_8_6a()  This figure has a surprising characteristic: some of the splits yield two terminal nodes that have the same predicted value.\nFor instance, consider the split Age\u0026lt;=57.5 near the bottom left of the unpruned tree. Regardless of the value of Age, a response value of No is predicted for those observations. Why, then, is the split performed at all?\nThe split is performed because it leads to increased node purity. That is, 2/81 of the observations corresponding to the left-hand leaf have a response value of Yes, whereas 9/36 of those corresponding to the right-hand leaf have a response value of Yes. Why is node purity important? Suppose that we have a test observation that belongs to the region given by that left-hand leaf. Then we can be pretty certain that its response value is No. In contrast, if a test observation belongs to the region given by the right-hand leaf, then its response value is probably No, but we are much less certain. Even though the split Age\u0026lt;=57.5 does not reduce the classification error, it improves the Gini index and the entropy, which are more sensitive to node purity.\nPruning for Classification We can repeat the pruning exercise also for the classification task.\n# Figure 8.6 b def make_figure_8_6b(): # Init fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(14,6)) fig.suptitle('Figure 8.6') # Plot scores ax1.plot(params, clf_scores); ax1.legend(['Train','Test','6-fold CV']); # Plot best tree plot_tree(best_model, filled=True, impurity=False, feature_names=features, fontsize=12, ax=ax2);  # Init J = 10 params = range(2,11) clf_scores = np.zeros((len(params),3)) best_score = 100 # Loop over all parameters for i,k in enumerate(params): # Model tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_leaf_nodes=k) # Loop J times temp_scores = np.zeros((J,3)) for j in range (J): # Loop over splits X2_train, X2_test, y2_train, y2_test = train_test_split(X2, y2, test_size=0.5, random_state=j) m = tree.fit(X2_train, y2_train) temp_scores[j,0] = mean_squared_error(m.predict(X2_train), y2_train) temp_scores[j,1] = mean_squared_error(m.predict(X2_test), y2_test) # Get CV score kf6 = KFold(n_splits=6) temp_scores[j,2] = -cross_val_score(tree, X2_train, y2_train, cv=kf6, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error').mean() # Save best model if temp_scores[j,2]\u0026lt;best_score: best_model = m best_score = temp_scores[j,2] # Average clf_scores[i,:] = np.mean(temp_scores, axis=0)  make_figure_8_6b()  Other Issues Missing Predictor Values There are usually 2 main ways to deal with missing values:\n discard the observations fill the missing values with predictions using the other observations (e.g. mean)  With trees we can do better:\n code them as a separate class (e.g. \u0026lsquo;missing\u0026rsquo;) generate splits using non-missing data and use non-missing variables on missing data to mimic the splits with missing data  Categorical Predictors When splitting a predictor having q possible unordered values, there are $2^{q−1} − 1$ possible partitions of the q values into two groups, and the computations become prohibitive for large $q$. However, with a $0 − 1$ outcome, this computation simplifies.\nLinear Combination Splits Rather than restricting splits to be of the form $X_j \\leq s$, one can allow splits along linear combinations of the form $a_j X_j \\leq s$. The weights $a_j$ become part of the optimization procedure.\nOther Tree-Building Procedures The procedure we have seen for building trees is called CART (Classification and Regression Tree). There are other procedures.\nThe Loss Matrix With respect to other methods, the choice of the loss functions plays a much more important role.\nBinary Splits You can do non-binary splits but in the end they are just weaker versions of binary splits.\nInstability Trees have very high variance.\nDifficulty in Capturing Additive Structure Trees are quite bad at modeling additive structures.\nLack of Smoothness Trees are not smooth.\nTrees vs Regression Advantages\n Trees are very easy to explain to people. In fact, they are even easier to explain than linear regression! Some people believe that decision trees more closely mirror human decision-making than do the regression and classification approaches seen in previous chapters. Trees can be displayed graphically, and are easily interpreted even by a non-expert (especially if they are small). Trees can easily handle qualitative predictors without the need to create dummy variables.  Disadvantages\n trees generally do not have the same level of predictive accuracy as some of the other regression and classification approaches seen in this book. trees can be very non-robust. In other words, a small change in the data can cause a large change in the final estimated tree.  7.2 Bagging, Random Forests, Boosting Bagging, random forests, and boosting use trees as building blocks to construct more powerful prediction models.\nBagging The main problem of decision trees is that they suffer from high variance. Bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, is a general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical learning method.\nThe main idea behind bagging is that, given a set of n independent observations $Z_1,\u0026hellip;,Z_n$, each with variance $\\sigma^2$, the variance of the mean $\\bar Z$ of the observations is given by $\\sigma^2/n$. In other words, averaging a set of observations reduces variance.\nIndeed bagging consists in taking many training sets from the population, build a separate prediction model using each training set, and average the resulting predictions. Since we do not have access to many training sets, we resort to bootstrapping.\nOut-of-Bag Error Estimation It turns out that there is a very straightforward way to estimate the test error of a bagged model, without the need to perform cross-validation or the validation set approach. Recall that the key to bagging is that trees are repeatedly fit to bootstrapped subsets of the observations. One can show that on average, each bagged tree makes use of around two-thirds of the observations. The remaining one-third of the observations not used to fit a given bagged tree are referred to as the out-of-bag (OOB) observations. We can predict the response for the ith observation using each of the trees in which that observation was OOB.\nWe are now going to compute the Gini index for the Heart dataset using different numbers of trees.\n# Init (takes a lot of time with J=30) params = range(2,50) bagging_scores = np.zeros((len(params),2)) J = 30; # Loop over parameters for i, k in enumerate(params): print(\u0026quot;Computing k=%1.0f\u0026quot; % k, end =\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # Repeat J temp_scores = np.zeros((J,2)) for j in range(J): X2_train, X2_test, y2_train, y2_test = train_test_split(X2, y2, test_size=0.5, random_state=j) bagging = BaggingClassifier(DecisionTreeClassifier(), max_samples=k, oob_score=True) bagging.fit(X2_train,y2_train) temp_scores[j,0] = bagging.score(X2_test, y2_test) temp_scores[j,1] = bagging.oob_score_ # Average bagging_scores[i,:] = np.mean(temp_scores, axis=0) print(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, end=\u0026quot;\\r\u0026quot;)  Computing k=49  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the Out-of-Bag error computed while generating the bagged estimator.\n# Make new figure 1 def make_new_figure_1(): # Init fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10,6)) fig.suptitle(\u0026quot;Estimated $R^2$\u0026quot;) # Plot scores ax.plot(params, bagging_scores); ax.legend(['Test','OOB']); ax.set_xlabel('Number of Trees'); ax.set_ylabel('R^2');  make_new_figure_1()  It can be shown that with B sufficiently large, OOB error is virtually equivalent to leave-one-out cross-validation error. The OOB approach for estimating the test error is particularly convenient when performing bagging on large data sets for which cross-validation would be computationally onerous.\nVariable Importance Measures As we have discussed, the main advantage of bagging is to reduce prediction variance. However, with bagging it can be difficult to interpret the resulting model. In fact we cannot draw trees anymore given we have too many of them.\nHowever, one can obtain an overall summary of the importance of each predictor using the RSS (for bagging regression trees) or the Gini index (for bagging classification trees). In the case of bagging regression trees, we can record the total amount that the RSS is decreased due to splits over a given predictor, averaged over all trees. A large value indicates an important predictor. Similarly, in the context of bagging classification trees, we can add up the total amount that the Gini index is decreased by splits over a given predictor, averaged over all trees.\n# Compute feature importance feature_importances = np.mean([tree.feature_importances_ for tree in bagging.estimators_], axis=0)  We can have a look at the importance of each feature.\n# Figure 8.9 def make_figure_8_9(): # Init fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(8,8)) ax.set_title('Figure 8.9: Feature Importance'); # Plot feature importance h1 = pd.DataFrame({'Importance':feature_importances*100}, index=features) h1 = h1.sort_values(by='Importance', axis=0, ascending=False) h1.plot(kind='barh', color='r', ax=ax) ax.set_xlabel('Variable Importance'); plt.yticks(fontsize=14); plt.gca().legend_ = None;  make_figure_8_9()  Random Forests Random forests provide an improvement over bagged trees by way of a small tweak that decorrelates the trees. As in bagging, we build a number of decision trees on bootstrapped training samples. But when building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of $m$ predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of $p$ predictors. The split is allowed to use only one of those m predictors. A fresh sample of $m$ predictors is taken at each split, and typically we choose $m \\sim \\sqrt{p}$ — that is, the number of predictors considered at each split is approximately equal to the square root of the total number of predictors\nIn other words, in building a random forest, at each split in the tree, the algorithm is not even allowed to consider a majority of the available predictors. This may sound crazy, but it has a clever rationale. Suppose that there is one very strong predictor in the data set, along with a number of other moderately strong predictors. Then in the collection of bagged trees, most or all of the trees will use this strong predictor in the top split. Consequently, all of the bagged trees will look quite similar to each other. Hence the predictions from the bagged trees will be highly correlated. Unfortunately, averaging many highly correlated quantities does not lead to as large of a reduction in variance as averaging many uncorrelated quantities. In particular, this means that bagging will not lead to a substantial reduction in variance over a single tree in this setting.\nRandom forests overcome this problem by forcing each split to consider only a subset of the predictors.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s split the data in 2 and compute test and estimated $R^2$, for both forest and trees.\nimport warnings warnings.simplefilter('ignore') # Init (takes a lot of time with J=30) params = range(2,50) forest_scores = np.zeros((len(params),2)) J = 30 # Loop over parameters for i, k in enumerate(params): print(\u0026quot;Computing k=%1.0f\u0026quot; % k, end =\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) # Repeat J temp_scores = np.zeros((J,2)) for j in range(J): X2_train, X2_test, y2_train, y2_test = train_test_split(X2, y2, test_size=0.5, random_state=j) forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=k, oob_score=True, max_features=\u0026quot;sqrt\u0026quot;) forest.fit(X2_train,y2_train) temp_scores[j,0] = forest.score(X2_test, y2_test) temp_scores[j,1] = forest.oob_score_ # Average forest_scores[i,:] = np.mean(temp_scores, axis=0) print(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, end=\u0026quot;\\r\u0026quot;)  Computing k=49  # Figure 8.8 def make_figure_8_8(): # Init fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10,6)) ax.set_title('Figure 8.8'); # Plot scores ax.plot(params, bagging_scores); ax.plot(params, forest_scores); ax.legend(['Test - Bagging','OOB - Bagging', 'Test - Forest','OOB - Forest']); ax.set_xlabel('Number of Trees'); ax.set_ylabel('R^2');  make_figure_8_8()  As for bagging, we can plot feature importance.\n# Make new figure 2 def make_new_figure_2(): # Init fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(15,7)) # Plot feature importance - Bagging h1 = pd.DataFrame({'Importance':feature_importances*100}, index=features) h1 = h1.sort_values(by='Importance', axis=0, ascending=False) h1.plot(kind='barh', color='r', ax=ax1) ax1.set_xlabel('Variable Importance'); ax1.set_title('Tree Bagging') # Plot feature importance h2 = pd.DataFrame({'Importance':forest.feature_importances_*100}, index=features) h2 = h2.sort_values(by='Importance', axis=0, ascending=False) h2.plot(kind='barh', color='r', ax=ax2) ax2.set_title('Random Forest') # All plots for ax in fig.axes: ax.set_xlabel('Variable Importance'); ax.legend([])  make_new_figure_2()  From the figure we observe that varaible importance ranking is similar with bagging and random forests, but there are significant differences.\nWe are now going to look at the importance of random forests using the Khan gene dataset.

Here we restrict our discussion of boosting to the context of decision trees.\nBoosting works similarly to bagging, except that the trees are grown sequentially: each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. Boosting does not involve bootstrap sampling; instead each tree is fit on a modified version of the original data set.\nWhat is the idea behind this procedure? Given the current model, we fit a decision tree to the residuals from the model. That is, we fit a tree using the current residuals, rather than the outcome $y$, as the response. We then add this new decision tree into the fitted function in order to update the residuals. Each of these trees can be rather small, with just a few terminal nodes, determined by the parameter $d$ in the algorithm. By fitting small trees to the residuals, we slowly improve $\\hat f$ in areas where it does not perform well. The shrinkage parameter λ slows the process down even further, allowing more and different shaped trees to attack the resid- uals. In general, statistical learning approaches that learn slowly tend to perform well.\nAlgorithm The boosting algorithm works as follows:\n  Set $\\hat f(x)=0$ and $r_i=y_i$ for all $i$ in the training set.\n  For $b=1,2,\u0026hellip;,B$ repeat:\na. Fit a tree $\\hat f^b $ with $d$ splits ($d+1$ terminal nodes) to the training data $(X,r)$.\nb. Update $\\hat f$ by adding in a shrunken version of the new tree: $$ \\hat f(x) \\leftarrow \\hat f(x) + \\lambda \\hat f^b(x) $$\nc. Update the residuals $$ r_i = r_i - \\lambda \\hat f^b(x_i) $$\n  Output the boosted model $$ \\hat{f}(x)=\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\lambda \\hat{f}^{b}(x) $$\n  Boosting has three tuning parameters:\n The number of trees $B$ The shrinkage parameter $\\lambda$. This controls the rate at which boosting learns. The number of splits in each tree $d$ , which controls the complexity of the boosted ensemble. Often d = 1 works well, in which case each tree is a stump, consisting of a single split.  # Init , oob_score=True params = range(50,150,10) boost_scores = np.zeros((len(params),3)) p = np.shape(X)[1] J = 30 # Loop over parameters for i, k in enumerate(params): # Repeat L times temp_scores = np.zeros((J,3)) for j in range(J): print(\u0026quot;Computing k=%1.0f (iter=%1.0f)\u0026quot; % (k,j+1), end =\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=20, random_state=j) # First score: random forest forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=k, max_features=\u0026quot;sqrt\u0026quot;) forest.fit(X_train, y_train) temp_scores[j,0] = forest.score(X_test, y_test) # Second score: boosting with 1-split trees boost1 = GradientBoostingClassifier(learning_rate=0.01, max_depth=1, n_estimators=k, max_features=\u0026quot;sqrt\u0026quot;) boost1.fit(X_train, y_train) temp_scores[j,1] = boost1.score(X_test, y_test) # Third score: boosting with 1-split trees boost2 = GradientBoostingClassifier(learning_rate=0.01, max_depth=2, n_estimators=k, max_features=\u0026quot;sqrt\u0026quot;) boost2.fit(X_train, y_train) temp_scores[j,2] = boost2.score(X_test, y_test) print(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, end=\u0026quot;\\r\u0026quot;) # Average boost_scores[i,:] = np.mean(temp_scores, axis=0)  Computing k=140 (iter=30)  Let\u0026rsquo;s compare boosting and forest.\n# Figure 8.11 def make_figure_8_11(): # Init fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(10,6)) ax.set_title('Figure 8.11'); # Plot scores ax.plot(params, m_scores); ax.legend(['forest','boosting with d=1','boosting with d=2']); ax.set_xlabel('Number of Trees'); ax.set_ylabel('Test Classification Accuracy');  make_figure_8_11()  ","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"54aa48269b53b49cab7798a7b9e67a1b","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/ml-econ/07_trees/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/ml-econ/07_trees/","section":"course","summary":"%matplotlib inline from utils.lecture07 import *  Decision Trees Decision trees involve segmenting the predictor space into a number of simple regions.

(The $\\delta$ that does it is the IV estimator.)\nIf the equations are overidentified, i.e. $L$ (number of instruments) $\u0026gt; K$ (number of equations), then the distance cannot be zero exactly in general, but we would expect the minimized distance to be close to zero.\nNaive Test Suppose your model is overidentified ($L \u0026gt; K$) and you use the following naive testing procedure:\n Estimate $\\hat{\\delta}$ using a subset of dimension $K$ of instruments $\\lbrace z_1 , .. , z_K\\rbrace$ for $\\lbrace x_1 , \u0026hellip; , x_K\\rbrace$ Set $\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i = y_i - x_i \\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{GMM}}$ Infer the size of the remaining $L-K$ moment conditions $\\mathbb E[z _{i, K+1} \\varepsilon_i], \u0026hellip;, \\mathbb E[z _{i, L} \\varepsilon_i]$ looking at their empirical counterparts $\\mathbb E_n[z _{i, K+1} \\hat{\\varepsilon}_i], \u0026hellip;, \\mathbb E_n[z _{i, L} \\hat{\\varepsilon}_i]$ Reject exogeneity if the empirical expectations are high. How high? Calculate p-values.  Example If you have two invalid instruments and you use one to test the validity of the other, it might happen by chance that you don’t reject it.\n  Model: $y_i = x_i + \\varepsilon_i$ and $x_i = \\frac{1}{2} z _{i1} - \\frac{1}{2} z _{i2} + u_i$\n  Have $$ Cov (z _{i1}, z _{i2}, \\varepsilon_i, u_i) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\newline 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \\newline 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1 \u0026amp; 0.5 \\newline 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0.5 \u0026amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n  You want to test whether the second instrument is valid (is not since $\\mathbb E[z_2 \\varepsilon] \\neq 0$).

This is a specification test, testing whether all model assumptions are true jointly. Only when we are confident that about the other assumptions, can we interpret a large $J$ statistic as evidence for the endogeneity of some of the $L$ instruments included in $x$. Unlike the tests we have encountered so far, the test is not consistent against some failures of the orthogonality conditions (that is, it is not consistent against some fixed elements of the alternative). Several papers in the July 1996 issue of JBES report that the finite-sample null rejection probability of the test can far exceed the nominal significance level $\\alpha$.  Special Case: Conditional Homoskedasticity The main implication of conditional homoskedasticity is that efficient GMM becomes 2SLS. With efficient GMM estimation, the weighting matrix is $\\hat{S}^{-1} = \\mathbb En [z_i z_i' \\varepsilon_i^2]^{-1}$. With conditional homoskedasticity, the efficient weighting matrix is $\\mathbb E_n[z_iz_i']^{-1} \\sigma^{-2}$, or equivalently $\\mathbb E_n[z_iz_i']^{-1}$. Then, the GMM estimator becomes $$ \\hat{\\delta}(\\hat{S}^{-1}) = \\Big(\\mathbb E_n[z_i x_i']' \\underbrace{\\mathbb E_n[z_iz_i']^{-1} \\mathbb E[z_i x_i']} _ {\\text{ols of } x_i \\text{ on }z_i} \\Big)^{-1}\\mathbb E_n[z_i x_i']' \\underbrace{\\mathbb E_n[z_iz_i']^{-1} \\mathbb E[z_i y_i']} _ {\\text{ols of } y_i \\text{ on }z_i}= \\hat{\\delta} _ {2SLS} $$\nProof: Consider the matrix notation. $$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat{\\delta} \\left( \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;Z}{n}\\right) \u0026amp;= \\left( \\frac{X\u0026rsquo;Z}{n} \\left( \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;Z}{n}\\right)^{-1} \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;X}{n} \\right)^{-1} \\frac{X\u0026rsquo;Z}{n} \\left( \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;Z}{n}\\right)^{-1} \\frac{Z\u0026rsquo;Y}{n} = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left( X\u0026rsquo;Z(Z\u0026rsquo;Z)^{-1} Z\u0026rsquo;X \\right)^{-1} X\u0026rsquo;Z(Z\u0026rsquo;Z)^{-1} Z\u0026rsquo;Y = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left(X\u0026rsquo;P_ZX\\right)^{-1} X\u0026rsquo;P_ZY = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left(X\u0026rsquo;P_ZP_ZX\\right)^{-1} X\u0026rsquo;P_ZY = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left(\\hat{X}'_Z \\hat{X}_Z\\right)^{-1} \\hat{X}'_ZY = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\hat{\\delta} _ {2SLS} \\end{aligned} $$ $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nSmall-Sample Properties of 2SLS Theorem: When the number of instruments is equal to the sample size ($L = n$), then $\\hat{\\delta} _ {2SLS} = \\hat{\\delta} _ {OLS}$\nProof: We have a perfect prediction problem.

This problem arises even if the instruments are valid.\n Example from Angrist (1992)  They regress wages on years of schooling. Problem: endogeneity: both variables are correlated with skills which are unobserved. Solution: instrument years of schooling with the quarter of birth.  Idea: if born in the first three quarters, can attend school from the year of your sixth birthday. Otherwise, you have to wait one more year.   Problem: quarters of birth are three dummies.  In order to ``improve the first stage fit” they interact them with year of birth (180 effective instruments) and also with the state (1527 effective instruments). This mechanically increases the $R^2$ but also increases the bias of the 2SLS estimator.   Solutions: LIML, JIVE, RJIVE (Hansen et al., 2014), Post-Lasso (Belloni et al., 2012).  Example from Angrist (1992) Many Instrument Robust Estimation Issue Why having too many instruments is problematic? As the number of instruments increases, the estimated coefficient gets closer to OLS which is biased. As seen in the theorem above, for $L=n$, the two estimators coincide.\nLIML An alternative method to estimate the parameters of the structural equation is by maximum likelihood. Anderson and Rubin (1949) derived the maximum likelihood estimator for the joint distribution of $(y_i, x_i)$. The estimator is known as limited information maximum likelihood, or LIML.\nThis estimator is called “limited information” because it is based on the structural equation for $(y_i, x_i)$ combined with the reduced form equation for $x_i$. If maximum likelihood is derived based on a structural equation for $x_i$ as well, then this leads to what is known as full information maximum likelihood (FIML). The advantage of the LIML approach relative to FIML is that the former does not require a structural model for $x_i$, and thus allows the researcher to focus on the structural equation of interest - that for $y_i$.\nK-class Estimators The k-class estimators have the form $$ \\hat{\\delta}(\\alpha) = (X' P_Z X - \\alpha X' X)^{-1} (X' P_Z Y - \\alpha X' Y) $$\nThe limited information maximum likelihood estimator LIML is the k-class estimator $\\hat{\\delta}(\\alpha)$ where $$ \\alpha = \\lambda_{min} \\Big( ([X' , Y]^{-1} [X' , Y])^{-1} [X' , Y]^{-1} P_Z [X' , Y] \\Big) $$\nIf $\\alpha = 0$ then $\\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{LIML}} = \\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{2SLS}}$ while for $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, $\\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{LIML}} \\to \\hat{\\delta} _ {\\text{OLS}}$.\nComments on LIML  The particular choice of $\\alpha$ gives a many instruments robust estimate The LIML estimator has no finite sample moments. $\\mathbb E[\\delta(\\alpha_{LIML})]$ does not exist in general In simulation studies performs well Has good asymptotic properties  Asymptotically the LIML estimator has the same distribution as 2SLS. However, they can have quite different behaviors in finite samples. There is considerable evidence that the LIML estimator has superior finite sample performance to 2SLS when there are many instruments or the reduced form is weak. However, on the other hand there is worry that since the LIML estimator is derived under normality it may not be robust in non-normal settings.\nJIVE The Jacknife IV procedure is the following\n Regress $\\lbrace x_j \\rbrace _ {j \\neq i}$ on $\\lbrace z_j \\rbrace _ {j \\neq i}$ and estimate $\\pi_{-i}$ (leave the $i^{th}$ observation out). Form $\\hat{x}_i = \\hat{\\pi} _ {-i} z_i$. Run IV using $\\hat{x}_i$ as instruments. $$ \\hat{\\delta} _ {JIVE} = \\mathbb E_n[\\hat{x}_i x_i']^{-1} \\mathbb E_n[\\hat{x}_i y_i'] $$  Comments on JIVE:  Prevents overfitting. With many instruments you get bad out of sample prediction which implies low correlation between $\\hat{x}_i$ and $x_i$: $\\mathbb E_n[\\hat{x}_i x_i'] \\simeq 0$. Use lasso/ridge regression in the first stage in case of too many instruments.  Hausman Test Here we consider testing the validity of OLS. OLS is generally preferred to IV in terms of precision. Many researchers only doubt the (joint) validity of the regressor $z_i$ instead of being certain that it is invalid (in the sense of not being predetermined). So then they wish to choose between OLS and 2SLS, assuming that they have an instrument vector $x_i$ whose validity is not in question. Further, assume for simplicity that $L = K$ so that the efficient GMM estimator is the IV estimator.\nThe Hausman test statistic $$ H \\equiv n (\\hat{\\delta} _ {IV} - \\hat{\\delta} _ {OLS})' [\\hat{Avar} (\\hat{\\delta} _ {IV} - \\hat{\\delta} _ {OLS})]^{-1} (\\hat{\\delta} _ {IV} - \\hat{\\delta} _ {OLS}) $$ is asymptotically distributed as a $\\chi^2_{L-s}$ under the null where $s = | z_i \\cup x_i |$: the number of regressors that are retained as instruments in $x_i$.\nComments In general, the idea of the Hausman test is the following. If you have two estimators, one which is efficient under $H_0$ but inconsistent under $H_1$ (in this case, OLS), and another which is consistent under $H_1$ (in this case, IV), then construct a test as a quadratic form in the differences of the estimators. Another classic example arises in panel data with the hypothesis $H_0$ of unconditional strict exogeneity. In that case, under $H_0$ Random Effects estimators are efficient but under $H_1$ they are inconsistent. Fixed Effects estimators instead are consistent under $H_1$.\nThe Hausman test statistic can be used as a pretest procedure: select either OLS or IV according to the outcome of the test. Although widely used, this pretest procedure is not advisable. When the null is false, it is still possible that the test accepts the null (committing a Type 2 error). In particular, this can happen with a high probability when the sample size is small and/or when the regressor $z_i$ is almost valid. In such an instance, estimation and also inference will be based on incorrect methods. Therefore, the overall properties of the Hausman pretest procedure are undesirable.\nThe Hausman test is an example of a specification test. There are many other specification tests. One could for example test for conditional homoskedasticity. Unlike for the OLS case, there does not exist a convenient test for conditional homoskedasticity for the GMM case. A test statistic that is asymptotically chi-squared under the null is available but is extremely cumbersome; see White (1982, note 2).

If HZ replaces in period $t$ ($a_t = 1$), then $s_t = 0$    Model (2) HZ static utility function (for a single bus) $$ u\\left(s_t, a_{t} ; \\theta\\right)= \\begin{cases}-c\\left(s_t ; \\theta\\right) \u0026amp; \\text { if } a_{t}=0 \\text { (not replace) } \\newline -R-c(0 ; \\theta) \u0026amp; \\text { if } a_{t}=1 \\text { (replace) }\\end{cases} $$ where\n $c(s_t ; \\theta)$: expected costs of operating a bus with mileage $s_t$  ​ including maintenance costs \u0026amp; social costs of breakdown We would expect $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial s}\u0026gt;0$   $R$ is the cost of replacement (i.e., a new engine)  Note that replacement occurs immediately   $u(s_t , a_t ; \\theta)$: expected current utility from operating a bus with mileage $s_t$ and making replacement decision $a_t$  Model (3) HZ objective function is to maximize the expected present discounted sum of future utilities $$ V(s_t ; \\theta) = \\max_{\\boldsymbol a} \\mathbb E_{s_{t+1}} \\left[\\sum_{\\tau=t}^{\\infty} \\beta^{\\tau-t} u\\left(s_{\\tau}, a_{\\tau} ; \\theta\\right) \\ \\Bigg| \\ s_t, \\boldsymbol a ; \\theta\\right] $$ where\n The expectation $\\mathbb E$ is over future $x$, which evolve according to Markov process $\\max$ is over future choices $a_{t+1}, \u0026hellip; ,a_{\\infty}$,  because HZ will observe future states $s_{\\tau}$ before choosing future actions $a_\\tau$, this is a functional    Notes\n This is for one bus (but multiple engines). HZ has an infinite horizon for his decision making $s_t$ summarizes state at time $t$, i.e., the expected value of future utilities only depends on $s_t$  Bellman Equation This (sequential) representation of HZ’s problem is very cumbersome to work with.\nWe can rewrite $V (s_t; \\theta)$ with the following Bellman equation $$ V\\left(s_t ; \\theta\\right) = \\max_{a_{t}} \\Bigg\\lbrace u\\left(s_t, a_{t} ; \\theta\\right)+\\beta \\mathbb E_{s_{t+1}} \\Big[V\\left(s_{t+1} ; \\theta\\right) \\Big| s_t, a_{t} ; \\theta\\Big] \\Bigg\\rbrace $$ Basically we are dividing the infinite sum (in the sequential form) into a present component and a future component.\nNotes:\n Same $V$ on both sides of equation because of infinite horizon - the future looks the same as the present for a given $s$ (i.e., it doesn’t matter where you are in time). The expectation $\\mathbb E$ is over the state-transition probabilities, $\\Pr (s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t ; \\theta)$  Order of Markow Process Suppose for a moment that $s_t$ follows a second-order markov process $$ s_{t+1}=f\\left(s_t, {\\color{red}{s_{t-1}}}, \\varepsilon ; \\theta\\right) $$ Now $s_t$ is not sufficient to describe current $V$\n We need both $s_t$ and $s_{t-1}$ in the state space (i.e., $V (s_t , {\\color{red}{s_{t-1}}}; \\theta)$ contains $s_{t-1}$, too), and the expectation is over the transition probability $\\Pr (s_{t+1} | s_t, {\\color{red}{s_{t-1}}}, a_t ; \\theta)$  Parenthesis: State Variables Which variables should be state variables? I.e. should be included in the state space?\nGeneral rule for 1st order markow processes: variables need to\n define expected current payoff, and define expectations over next period state (i.e., distribution of $s_{t+1}$)  What do you do otherwise? Integrate them out! Examples\n Weather affects static utitilies but not transition probabilities  More annoying to replace the engine if it rains Integration means: “compute expected utility of Harold Zurcher before he opens the window”   Month of the year affects transition probabilities but not utilities  Buses are used more in the winter Integration means: “compute average transition probabilities over months”     Note: you can always get the non-expected value function if you know the probability of raining or the transition probabilities by month\n Policy Function Along with this value function comes a corresponding policy (or choice) function mapping the state $s_t$ into HZ’s optimal replacement choice $a_t$ $$ P \\left(s_t ; \\theta\\right) = \\max_{a_{t}} \\Bigg\\lbrace u\\left(s_t, a_{t} ; \\theta\\right) + \\beta \\mathbb E_{s_{t+1}} \\Big[ V \\left(s_{t+1} ; \\theta\\right) \\Big| s_t, a_{t} ; \\theta\\Big] \\Bigg\\rbrace $$ Given $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial s}\u0026gt;0$, the policy function has the form $$ P \\left(s_t ; \\theta\\right) = \\begin{cases}1 \u0026amp; \\text { if } s_t \\geq \\gamma(\\theta) \\newline 0 \u0026amp; \\text { if } s_t\u0026lt;\\gamma(\\theta)\\end{cases} $$ where $\\gamma$ is the replacement mileage.\nHow would this compare with the optimal replacement mileage if HZ was myopic?\n Answer: HZ would wait until $R \\leq c(s)$ for the replacement action  Solving the Model Why do we want to solve for the value and policy functions?\n We want to know the agent’s optimal behavior and the equilibrium outcomes and be able to conduct comparative statics/dynamics (a.k.a. counterfactual simulations)  We have the Bellman Equation $$ V\\left(s_t ; \\theta\\right) = \\max_{a_{t}} \\Bigg\\lbrace u\\left(s_t, a_{t} ; \\theta\\right)+\\beta \\mathbb E_{s_{t+1}} \\Big[V\\left(s_{t+1} ; \\theta\\right) \\ \\Big| \\ s_t, a_{t} ; \\theta\\Big] \\Bigg\\rbrace $$ Which we can compactly write as $$ V\\left(s_t ; \\theta\\right) = T \\Big( V\\left(s_{t+1} ; \\theta\\right) \\Big) $$ Blackwell’s Theorem: under regularity conditions, $T$ is a contraction mapping with modulus $\\beta$.\nContraction Mapping Theorem: $T$ has a fixed point and we can find it by iterating $T$ from any starting value $V^{(0)}$.\nValue Function Iteration What does Blackwell’s Theorem allow us to do?\n Start with any arbitrary function $V^{(0)}(\u0001\\cdot)$ Apply the mapping $T$ to get $V^{(1)}(\u0001\\cdot) = T (V^{(0)}(\u0001\\cdot))$ Apply again $V^{(2)}(\\cdot\u0001) = T (V^{(1)}(\\cdot\u0001))$ Continue applying $T$ , and $V^{(k)}$ will converge to the unique fixed point of $T$  i.e., the true value function $V(s_t; \\theta)$   Once we have $V(s_t; \\theta)$, it’s fairly trivial to compute the policy function $P(s_t; \\theta)$  Static optimization problem (given $V$)    This process is called value function iteration\nHow to Reconcile Model and Data?

sklearn has a library for neural networks, it is very basic and not the standard in the industry. The most commonly used libraries as of 2020 are Tensorflow and Pytorch.\n  TensorFlow is developed by Google Brain and actively used at Google both for research and production needs. Its closed-source predecessor is called DistBelief.\n  PyTorch is a cousin of lua-based Torch framework which was developed and used at Facebook. However, PyTorch is not a simple set of wrappers to support popular language, it was rewritten and tailored to be fast and feel native.\n  Here is an article that explains very well the difference between the two libraries: pytorch-vs-tensorflow. In short, pytorch is much more intuitive for a python programmer and more user friendly. It also has a superior development and debugging experience. However, if you want more control on the fundamentals, a better community support and you need to train large models, Tensorflow is better.\n8.1 Introduction The term neural network has evolved to encompass a large class of models and learning methods. Here I describe the most widely used “vanilla” neural net, sometimes called the single hidden layer back-propagation network, or single layer perceptron.\nRegression Imagine a setting with two inputs available (let’s denote these inputs $i_1$ and $i_2$), and no special knowledge about the relationship between these inputs and the output that we want to predict (denoted by $o$) except that this relationship is, a priori, pretty complex and non-linear.\nSo we want to learn the function $f$ such that f($i_1$, $i_2$) is a good estimator of $o$. We could then suggest the following first model:\n$$ o = w_{11} i_1 + w_{12} i_2 $$\nwhere $w_{11}$ and $w_{12}$ are just weights/coefficients (do not take care about the indices for now). Before going any further, we should notice that, here, there is no constant term in the model. However, we could have introduced such term by setting $f(i_1, i_2) = w_{11} i_1 + w_{12} i_2 + c$. The constant is often called bias.\nWe can represent the setting as follows.\nIn this case, the model is easy to understand and to fit but has a big drawback : there is no non-linearity! This obviously do not respect our non-linear assumption.\nActivation Functions In order to introduce a non-linearity, let us make a little modification in the previous model and suggest the following one.\n$$ o = a ( w_{11} i_1 + w_{12} i_2) $$\nwhere $a$ is a function called activation function which is non-linear.\nOne activation function that is well known in economics (and other disciplines) is the sigmoid function or logit function\n$$ a (w_{11} i_1 + w_{12} i_2) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{w_{11} i_1 + w_{12} i_2}} $$\nLayers However, even if better than multilinear model, this model is still too simple and can’t handle the assumed underlying complexity of the relationship between inputs and output. We can make a step further and enrich the model the following way.\n First we could consider that the quantity $a ( w_{11} i_1 + w_{12} i_2)$ is no longer the final output but instead a new intermediate feature of our function, called $l_1$, which stands for layer.  $$ l_1 = a ( w_{11} i_1 + w_{12} i_2) $$\nSecond we could consider that we build several (3 in our example) such features in the same way, but possibly with different weights and different activation functions  $$ l_1 = a ( w_{11} i_1 + w_{12} i_2) \\ l_2 = a ( w_{21} i_1 + w_{22} i_2) \\ l_3 = a ( w_{31} i_1 + w_{32} i_2) $$\nwhere the $a$’s are just activation functions and the $w$’s are weights.\nFinally, we can consider that our final output is build based on these intermediate features with the same “template”  $$ a_2 ( v_1 l_1 + v_2 l_2 + v_3 * l_3 ) $$\nIf we aggregate all the pieces, we then get our prediction $p$\n$$ \\begin{aligned} p = f_{3}\\left(i_{1}, i_{2}\\right) \u0026amp;=a_{2}\\left(v_{1} l_{1}+v_{2} l_{2}+v_{3} l_{3}\\right) \\ \u0026amp;=a_{2}\\left(v_{1} \\times a_{11}\\left(w_{11} i_{1}+w_{12} i_{2}\\right)+v_{2} \\times a_{12}\\left(w_{21} i_{1}+w_{22} i_{2}\\right)+v_{3} \\times a_{13}\\left(w_{31} i_{1}+w_{32} i_{2}\\right)\\right) \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere we should mainly keep in mind that $a$’s are non-linear activation functions and $w$’s and $v$’s are weights.\nGraphically:\nThis last model is a basic feedforward neural network with:\n 2 entries ($i_1$ and $i_2$) 1 hidden layer with 3 hidden neurones (whose outputs are $l_1$, $l_2$ and $l_3$) 1 final output ($p$)  Pytorch Tensors We can express the data as a numpy array.\nx_np = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2)) x_np  array([[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]])  Or equivalently as a pytorch tensor.\nx_tensor = torch.from_numpy(x_np) x_tensor  tensor([[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]])  We can also translate tensors back to arrays.\ntensor2array = x_tensor.numpy() tensor2array  array([[0, 1], [2, 3], [4, 5]])  We can make operations over this data. For example we can take the mean\ntry: torch.mean(x_tensor) except Exception as e: print(e)  mean(): input dtype should be either floating point or complex dtypes. Got Long instead.

So torch does not have placeholder, torch can just pass variable to the computational graph.\n# build a variable, usually for compute gradients x_variable = Variable(x_tensor, requires_grad=True) x_variable  tensor([[0., 1.], [2., 3.], [4., 5.]], requires_grad=True)  Until now the tensor and variable seem the same. However, the variable is a part of the graph, it\u0026rsquo;s a part of the auto-gradient.\nSuppose we are interested in:\n$$ y = \\text{mean} (x_1^2) = \\frac{1}{6} x^2 $$\ny = torch.mean(x_variable*x_variable) print(y)  tensor(9.1667, grad_fn=\u0026lt;MeanBackward0\u0026gt;)  We can compute the gradient by backpropagation\n$$ \\nabla y(x) = \\frac{2}{3} x $$\ni.e. if we call the backward method on our outcome y, we see that the gradient of our variable x gets updated.\nprint(x_variable.grad)  None  y.backward()  print(x_variable.grad)  tensor([[0.0000, 0.3333], [0.6667, 1.0000], [1.3333, 1.6667]])  However, its value has not changed.\nprint(x_variable)  tensor([[0., 1.], [2., 3.], [4., 5.]], requires_grad=True)  We can also access the tensor part of the variable alone by calling the data method.\nprint(x_variable.data)  tensor([[0., 1.], [2., 3.], [4., 5.]])  Activation Function The main advantage of neural networks is that they introduce non-linearities among the layers.

Remember that linear regression can be interpreted as the simplest possible NN.\nWe generate the following data:\n$$ y = 1 + 2 x - 3 x^2 + \\varepsilon $$\nwith $x \\sim N(0,1)$ and $\\varepsilon \\sim N(0,0.1)$\n# Data Generation np.random.seed(42) N = 100 x = np.sort(np.random.rand(N, 1), axis=0) e = .1*np.random.randn(N, 1) y_true = 1 + 2*x - 3*x**2 y = y_true + e  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the data.\n# New figure 2 def make_new_figure_2(): # Init fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,6)) fig.suptitle('Activation Functions') # Scatter ax.scatter(x,y); ax.plot(x,y_true,color='orange'); ax.set_xlabel('X'); ax.set_ylabel('Y'); ax.legend(['y true','y']);  make_new_figure_2()  Suppose we try to fit the data with a linear model\n$$ y = a + b x $$\nWe proceed iteratively by gradient descent. Our objective function is the Mean Squared Error.\nAlgorithm\n Take an initial guess of the parameters $$ a = a_0 \\ b = b_0 $$\n  Compute the Mean Squared Error $$ \\begin{array} \\text{MSE} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(y_{i}-\\hat{y}{i}\\right)^{2} \\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum{i=1}^{N}\\left(y_{i}-a-b x_{i}\\right)^{2} \\end{array} $$\n  Compute its derivative $$ \\begin{array}{l} \\frac{\\partial M S E}{\\partial a}=\\frac{\\partial M S E}{\\partial \\hat{y}{i}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}{i}}{\\partial a}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2\\left(y_{i}-a-b x_{i}\\right) \\cdot(-1)=-2 \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(y_{i}-\\hat{y}{i}\\right) \\ \\frac{\\partial M S E}{\\partial b}=\\frac{\\partial M S E}{\\partial \\hat{y}{i}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}{i}}{\\partial b}=\\frac{1}{N} \\sum{i=1}^{N} 2\\left(y_{i}-a-b x_{i}\\right) \\cdot\\left(-x_{i}\\right)=-2 \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}\\left(y_{i}-\\hat{y}_{i}\\right) \\end{array} $$\n  Update the parameters $$ \\begin{array}{l} a=a-\\eta \\frac{\\partial M S E}{\\partial a} \\ b=b-\\eta \\frac{\\partial M S E}{\\partial b} \\end{array} $$\nWhere $\\eta$ is the learning rate. A lower learning rate makes learning more stable but slower.\n  Repeat (1)-(3) $T$ times, where the number of total iterations $T$ is called epochs.\n  We start by taking a random guess of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n# Initializes parameters \u0026quot;a\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;b\u0026quot; randomly np.random.seed(42) a = np.random.randn(1) b = np.random.randn(1) print(a, b)  [0.49671415] [-0.1382643]  # Plot gradient def gradient_plot(x, y, y_hat, y_true, EPOCHS, losses): clear_output(wait=True) fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(12,5)) # First figure ax1.clear() ax1.scatter(x, y) ax1.plot(x, y_true, 'orange') ax1.plot(x, y_hat, 'r-') ax1.set_title('Data and Fit') ax1.legend(['True', 'Predicted']) # Second figure ax2.clear() ax2.plot(range(len(losses)), losses, color='g') ax2.set_xlim(0,EPOCHS); ax2.set_ylim(0,1.1*np.max(losses)) ax2.set_title('True MSE = %.4f' % losses[-1]) # Plot plt.show();  We set the learning rate $\\eta = 0.1$ and the number of epochs $T=200$\n# parameters LR = 0.1 # learning rate EPOCHS = 200 # number of epochs  We can now plot the training and the result.\n# New figure 3 def make_new_figure_3(a, b): # Init losses = [] # train for t in range(EPOCHS): # compute loss y_hat = a + b * x error = (y - y_hat) loss = (error**2).mean() # compute gradient a_grad = -2 * error.mean() b_grad = -2 * (x * error).mean() # update parameters a -= LR * a_grad b -= LR * b_grad # plot losses += [loss] if (t+1) % (EPOCHS/25) == 0: # print 25 times gradient_plot(x, y, y_hat, y_true, EPOCHS, losses) print(a, b) return a, b  a_fit, b_fit = make_new_figure_3(a, b)  [1.40589939] [-0.83739496]  Sanity Check: do we get the same results as our gradient descent?\n# OLS estimates ols = LinearRegression() ols.fit(x, y) print(ols.intercept_, ols.coef_[0])  [1.4345303] [-0.89397853]  Close enough!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s plot both lines in the graph.\n# New figure 4 def make_new_figure_4(): # Init fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,6)) # Scatter ax.plot(x,y_true,color='orange'); ax.plot(x,a_fit + b_fit*x,color='red'); ax.plot(x,ols.predict(x),color='green'); ax.legend(['y true','y gd', 'y ols']) ax.scatter(x,y); ax.set_xlabel('X'); ax.set_ylabel('Y'); ax.set_title(\u0026quot;Data\u0026quot;);  make_new_figure_4()  Now we are going to do exactly the same but with pytorch.\nAutograd Autograd is PyTorch’s automatic differentiation package. Thanks to it, we don’t need to worry about partial derivatives, chain rule or anything like it.\nSo, how do we tell PyTorch to do its thing and compute all gradients? That’s what backward() is good for. § Do you remember the starting point for computing the gradients? It was the loss, as we computed its partial derivatives w.r.t. our parameters. Hence, we need to invoke the backward() method from the corresponding Python variable, like, loss.backward().\nWhat about the actual values of the gradients? We can inspect them by looking at the grad attribute of a tensor.\nIf you check the method’s documentation, it clearly states that gradients are accumulated. So, every time we use the gradients to update the parameters, we need to zero the gradients afterwards. And that’s what zero_() is good for.\nWhat does the underscore (_) at the end of the method name mean? Do you remember? If not, scroll back to the previous section and find out.\nSo, let’s ditch the manual computation of gradients and use both backward() and zero_() methods instead.\nFirst, we convert our variables to tensors.\n# Convert data to tensors x_tensor = torch.from_numpy(x).float().to('cpu') y_tensor = torch.from_numpy(y).float().to('cpu') print(type(x), type(x_tensor))  \u0026lt;class 'numpy.ndarray'\u0026gt; \u0026lt;class 'torch.Tensor'\u0026gt;  We take the initial parameters guess\n# initial parameter guess torch.manual_seed(42) a = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float, device='cpu') b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float, device='cpu')  Now we are ready to fit the model.\n# New figure 5 def make_new_figure_5(a, b): # Init losses = [] # parameters LR = 0.1 EPOCHS = 200 # train for t in range(EPOCHS): # compute loss y_hat = a + b * x_tensor error = y_tensor - y_hat loss = (error ** 2).mean() # compute gradient loss.backward() # update parameters with torch.no_grad(): a -= LR * a.grad b -= LR * b.grad # clear gradients a.grad.zero_() b.grad.zero_() # Plot losses += [((y_true - y_hat.detach().numpy())**2).mean()] if (t+1) % (EPOCHS/25) == 0: # print 25 times gradient_plot(x, y, y_hat.data.numpy(), y_true, EPOCHS, losses) print(a, b)  make_new_figure_5(a, b)  tensor([1.3978], requires_grad=True) tensor([-0.8214], requires_grad=True)  Optimizer So far, we’ve been manually updating the parameters using the computed gradients. That’s probably fine for two parameters… but what if we had a whole lot of them?! We use one of PyTorch’s optimizers.\nAn optimizer takes the following arguments:\n the parameters we want to update he learning rate we want to use (possibly many other hyper-parameters)  Moreover, we can now call the function zero_grad() to automatically update the parameters. In particular, we will need to perform the following steps at each iteration:\n Clear the parameters: optimizer.zero_grad() Compute the gradient: loss.backward() Update the parameters: optimizer.step()  In the code below, we create a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer to update our parameters $a$ and $b$.\n# Init parameters torch.manual_seed(42) a = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float, device='cpu') b = torch.randn(1, requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float, device='cpu') # Defines a SGD optimizer to update the parameters optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([a, b], lr=LR) print(optimizer)  SGD ( Parameter Group 0 dampening: 0 lr: 0.1 momentum: 0 nesterov: False weight_decay: 0 )  We can also define a default loss function so that we don\u0026rsquo;t have to compute it by hand. We are going to use the MSE loss function.\n# Define a loss function loss_func = torch.nn.MSELoss() print(loss_func)  MSELoss()  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the estimator and the MSE.\n# New figure 6 def make_new_figure_6(a, b): # parameters EPOCHS = 200 # init losses = [] # train for t in range(EPOCHS): # compute loss y_hat = a + b * x_tensor error = y_tensor - y_hat loss = (error ** 2).mean() # update parameters optimizer.zero_grad() # clear gradients for next train loss.backward() # backpropagation, compute gradients optimizer.step() # apply gradients, update parameters # Plot losses += [((y_true - y_hat.detach().numpy())**2).mean()] if (t+1) % (EPOCHS/25) == 0: gradient_plot(x, y, y_hat.data.numpy(), y_true, EPOCHS, losses) print(a, b)  make_new_figure_6(a, b)  tensor([1.3978], requires_grad=True) tensor([-0.8214], requires_grad=True)  Building a NN In our model, we manually created two parameters to perform a linear regression.

It has been batch gradient descent all along.\nThis is fine for our ridiculously small dataset, sure, but if we want to go serious about all this, we must use mini-batch gradient descent. Thus, we need mini-batches. Thus, we need to slice our dataset accordingly. Do you want to do it manually?! Me neither!\nSo we use PyTorch’s DataLoader class for this job. We tell it which dataset to use (the one we just built in the previous section), the desired mini-batch size and if we’d like to shuffle it or not. That’s it!\nOur loader will behave like an iterator, so we can loop over it and fetch a different mini-batch every time.\n# Init data x_tensor = torch.from_numpy(x).float().to('cpu') y_tensor = torch.from_numpy(y).float().to('cpu') torch_dataset = Data.TensorDataset(x_tensor, y_tensor) # Build DataLoader BATCH_SIZE = 25 loader = Data.DataLoader( dataset=torch_dataset, # torch TensorDataset format batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, # mini batch size shuffle=True, # random shuffle for training )  Let\u0026rsquo;s try using sub-samples of dimension BATCH_SIZE = 25.\ndef train_NN_batch(loader, y_true, net, optimizer, loss_func, EPOCHS): # init losses = [] # train for t in range(EPOCHS): # train entire dataset 3 times for step, (batch_x, batch_y) in enumerate(loader): # compute loss y_hat = net(batch_x) loss = loss_func(y_hat, batch_y) # update parameters optimizer.zero_grad() # clear gradients for next train loss.backward() # backpropagation, compute gradients optimizer.step() # apply gradients # plt every epoch y_hat = net(x_tensor) losses += [((y_true - y_hat.detach().numpy())**2).mean()] if (t+1) % (EPOCHS/25) == 0: gradient_plot(x, y, y_hat.data.numpy(), y_true, EPOCHS, losses)  # parameters LR = 0.1 EPOCHS = 1000 net = torch.nn.Sequential(torch.nn.Linear(1, 10), torch.nn.ReLU(), torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)) optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=LR) loss_func = torch.nn.MSELoss() # Train train_NN_batch(loader, y_true, net, optimizer, loss_func, EPOCHS)  Two things are different now: not only we have an inner loop to load each and every mini-batch from our DataLoader but, more importantly, we are now sending only one mini-batch to the device.\nFor bigger datasets, loading data sample by sample (into a CPU tensor) using Dataset’s __get_item__ and then sending all samples that belong to the same mini-batch at once to your GPU (device) is the way to go in order to make the best use of your graphics card’s RAM.\nMoreover, if you have many GPUs to train your model on, it is best to keep your dataset “agnostic” and assign the batches to different GPUs during training.\n8.4 Advanced Topics Issues Starting Values Usually starting values for weights are chosen to be random values near zero. Hence the model starts out nearly linear, and becomes nonlinear as the weights increase.\nOverfitting In early developments of neural networks, either by design or by accident, an early stopping rule was used to avoid overfitting.\nA more explicit method for regularization is weight decay.\nScaling of the Inputs Since the scaling of the inputs determines the effective scaling of the weights in the bottom layer, it can have a large effect on the quality of the final solution. At the outset it is best to standardize all inputs to have mean zero and standard deviation one.\nNumber of Hidden Units and Layers Generally speaking it is better to have too many hidden units than too few. With too few hidden units, the model might not have enough flexibility to capture the nonlinearities in the data; with too many hidden units, the extra weights can be shrunk toward zero if appropriate regularization is used.\nChoice of the number of hidden layers is guided by background knowledge and experimentation. Each layer extracts features of the input for regression or classification. Use of multiple hidden layers allows construction of hierarchical features at different levels of resolution.\nYou can get an intuition on the role of hidden layers here: https://playground.tensorflow.org/\nMultiple Minima The error function R(θ) is nonconvex, possessing many local minima. One approach is to use the average predictions over the collection of networks as the final prediction. Another approach is via bagging.\nDeep Neural Networks and Deep Learning Deep Neural Networks are just Neural Networks with more than one hidden layer.\nConvolutional Neural Nets Convolutional Neural Nets are often applied when dealing with image/video data. They are usually coded with each feature being a pixel and its value is the pixel color (3 dimensional RGB array).\nVideos and images have 2 main characteristics:\n have lots of features \u0026ldquo;close\u0026rdquo; features are often similar  Convolutional Neural Nets exploit the second characteristic to alleviate the computational problems arising from the first. They do it by constructing a first layer that does not build on evey feature but only on adjacent ones.\nIn this way, most of the information is preserved, on a lower dimensional representation.\nRecurrent Neural Nets Recurrent Neural Networks are often applied in contexts in which the data generating process is dynamic. The most important example is Natural Language Processing. The idea is that you want to make predictions \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; as data comes in. Moreover, the order of the data is relevant, so that you also what to keep track of what the model has learned so far.\nWhile RNNs learn similarly while training, in addition, they remember things learnt from prior input(s) while generating output(s). It’s part of the network. RNNs can take one or more input vectors and produce one or more output vectors and the output(s) are influenced not just by weights applied on inputs like a regular NN, but also by a “hidden” state vector representing the context based on prior input(s)/output(s). So, the same input could produce a different output depending on previous inputs in the series.\nGrafically:\nIn summary, in a vanilla neural network, a fixed size input vector is transformed into a fixed size output vector. Such a network becomes “recurrent” when you repeatedly apply the transformations to a series of given input and produce a series of output vectors.\nBidirectional RNN Sometimes it’s not just about learning from the past to predict the future, but we also need to look into the future to fix the past. In speech recognition and handwriting recognition tasks, where there could be considerable ambiguity given just one part of the input, we often need to know what’s coming next to better understand the context and detect the present.\nThis does introduce the obvious challenge of how much into the future we need to look into, because if we have to wait to see all inputs then the entire operation will become costly.\nRecursive Neural Netw A recurrent neural network parses the inputs in a sequential fashion. A recursive neural network is similar to the extent that the transitions are repeatedly applied to inputs, but not necessarily in a sequential fashion. Recursive Neural Networks are a more general form of Recurrent Neural Networks. It can operate on any hierarchical tree structure. Parsing through input nodes, combining child nodes into parent nodes and combining them with other child/parent nodes to create a tree like structure. Recurrent Neural Networks do the same, but the structure there is strictly linear. i.e. weights are applied on the first input node, then the second, third and so on.\nBut this raises questions pertaining to the structure. How do we decide that? If the structure is fixed like in Recurrent Neural Networks then the process of training, backprop etc makes sense in that they are similar to a regular neural network. But if the structure isn’t fixed, is that learnt as well?\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"9d0e7e97b8f20fca1686acda2d5705cf","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/ml-econ/08_neuralnets/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/ml-econ/08_neuralnets/","section":"course","summary":"# Remove warnings import warnings warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')  # Import everything import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import statsmodels.api as sm import copy import torch import torch.","tags":null,"title":"Neural Networks","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Intro Setting: agents making strategic decisions (new) in dynamic environments.\n Entry and exit: Collard-Wexler (2013) Sunk costs: Ryan (2012) Innovation: Goettler and Gordon (2011)  (or whatever changes in response to investment)   Exploitation of natural resources: Huang and Smith (2014) Durable goods: Esteban and Shum (2007)   Lit review: forthcoming IO Handbook chapter Aguirregabiria, Collard-Wexler, and Ryan (2021)\n Single- vs Multi-Agent Typically in IO we study agents in strategic environments.

(2010) and Borkovsky, Doraszelski, and Kryukov (2010): homotopy method  can find some equilibria, but not all complicated to implement: need to compute first order conditions $H(\\boldsymbol V, \\theta) = 0$ and their Jacobian $\\Delta H(\\boldsymbol V, \\theta)$ Idea: trace the equilibrium correspondence $H^{-1} = \\lbrace (\\boldsymbol V, \\theta) : H(\\boldsymbol V, \\theta) = 0 \\rbrace$ in the value-parameter space   Eibelshäuser and Poensgen (2019)  Markov Quantal Response Equilibrium approact dynamic games from a evolutionary game theory perspective  actions played at random and those bringing highest payoffs survive   $\\to$ homothopy method guaranteed to find one equilibrium   Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler (2010): some equilibria are not Lyapunov-stable  BR iteration cannot find them unless you start exactly at the solution   Su and Judd (2012) and Egesdal, Lai, and Su (2015): same point, but numerically  using MPEC approach    Multiple Equilibria (2) Can we assume them away?\n Igami (2017)  Finite horizon Homogenous firms (in profit functions and state transitions) One dynamic move per period (overall, not per-firm)   Abbring and Campbell (2010)  Entry/exit game Homogeneous firms Entry and exit decisions are follow a last-in first-out (LIFO) structure  “An entrant expects to produce no longer than any incumbent”     Iskhakov, Rust, and Schjerning (2016)  can find all equilibria, but for very specific class of dynamic games must always proceed “forward”  e.g. either entry or exit but not both   Idea: can solve by backward induction even if horizon is infinite    Curse of Dimensionality What are the computational bottlenecks? $$ V^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}}{j} ({\\color{red}{\\mathbf{s}{t}}}) = \\max_{a_{jt} \\in \\mathcal{A}j \\left(\\mathbf{s}{t}\\right)} \\Bigg\\lbrace \\pi_{j}^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}} (a_{jt}, \\mathbf{s}{t} ; \\theta^\\pi ) + \\beta \\mathbb E{{\\color{red}{\\mathbf{s}{t+1}}}} \\Big[ V{j}^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}} \\left(\\mathbf{s}{t+1}\\right) \\ \\Big| \\ a{jt}, \\boldsymbol s_{t} ; \\theta^f \\Big] \\Bigg\\rbrace $$\n Dimension of the state space  In single agent problems, we have as many states as many values of $s_{jt}$ ($k$) In dynamics games, the state space goes from $k$ to $k^J$ symmetry helps: state $[1,2,3]$ and $[1,3,2]$ become the same for firm 1 How much do we gain? From $k^J$ to $k \\cdot {k + J - 2 \\choose k - 1}$   Dimension of the integrand  If in single agent problems, we have to integrate over $\\kappa$ outcomes,  4 in Rust: engine replaced (yes|no) $\\times$ mileage increases (yes|no)   … in dynamic games, we have to consider $\\kappa^J$ outcomes     Note: bottlenecks are not addittive but multiplicative: have to solve the expectation for each point in the state space. Improving on any of the two helps a lot.\n Curse of Dimensionality (2) Two and a half classes of solutions:\n Computational: approximate the equilibrium  Doraszelski (2003): use Chebyshev polynomials for a basis function Farias, Saure, and Weintraub (2012): combine approximations with a MPEC-like approach   Conceptual: define another game  Weintraub, Benkard, and Van Roy (2008): oblivious equilibrium Ifrach and Weintraub (2017): moment based equilibrium Doraszelski and Judd (2012): games in continuous time Doraszelski and Judd (2019): games with random moves   Kind of both: Pakes and McGuire (2001)  experience-based equilibrium (Fershtman and Pakes 2012)     Note: useful also to get good starting values for a full solution method!\n Oblivious Equilibrium Weintraub, Benkard, and Van Roy (2008): what if firms had no idea about the state of other firms?\n or atomistic firms  The value function becomes $$ V_{j} ({\\color{red}{s_{t}}}) = \\max_{a_{jt} \\in \\mathcal{A}j \\left({\\color{red}{s{t}}}\\right)} \\Bigg\\lbrace {\\color{red}{\\mathbb E_{\\boldsymbol s_t}}} \\Big[ \\pi_{j} (a_{jt}, \\mathbf{s}{t} ; \\theta^\\pi ) \\Big| P \\Big] + \\beta \\mathbb E{{\\color{red}{s_{t+1}}}} \\Big[ V_{j} \\left({\\color{red}{s_{t+1}}}\\right) \\ \\Big| \\ a_{jt}, {\\color{red}{s_{t}}} ; \\theta^f \\Big] \\Bigg\\rbrace $$\n Now the state is just $s_t$ instead of $\\boldsymbol s_t$  Huge computational gain: from $k^J$ points to $k$ Also the expectation of future states is taken over $3$ instead of $3^J$ points  (3 because quality can go up, down or stay the same)     But need to compute static profits as the expected value given the current policy function  Need to keep track of the asymptotic state distribution as you iterate the value    Games with Random Moves Doraszelski and Judd (2019): what if instead of simultaneously, firms would move one at the time at random?\n Important: to have the same frequency of play, a period now is $J$ times shorter  The value function becomes $$ V^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}}{j} (\\mathbf{s}{t}, {\\color{red}{n=j}}) = \\max_{a_{jt} \\in \\mathcal{A}j \\left(\\mathbf{s}{t}\\right)} \\Bigg\\lbrace {\\color{red}{\\frac{1}{J}}}\\pi_{j}^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}} (a_{jt}, \\mathbf{s}{t} ; \\theta^\\pi ) + {\\color{red}{\\sqrt[J]{\\beta}}} \\mathbb E{{\\color{red}{n, s_{j, t+1}}}} \\Big[ V_{j}^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}} \\left(\\mathbf{s}{t+1}, {\\color{red}{n}} \\right) \\ \\Big| \\ a{jt}, \\boldsymbol s_{t} ; \\theta^f \\Big] \\Bigg\\rbrace $$\n $n$: indicates whose turn is to play since a turn is $J$ times shorter, profits are $\\frac{1}{J} \\pi$ and discount factor is $\\sqrt[J]{\\beta}$  Computational gain\n Expectation now taken over $n, s_{j, t+1}$ instead of $\\boldsymbol s_{t+1}$ I.e. $Jk$ points instead of $3^k$ (3 because quality can go up, down or stay the same) Huge computational difference!  Games in Continuous Time Doraszelski and Judd (2012): what’s the advantage of continuous time?\n Probability that two firms take a decision simultaneously is zero  With continuous time, the value function becomes $$ V^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}}{j} (\\mathbf{s}{t}) = \\max_{a_{jt} \\in \\mathcal{A}j \\left(\\mathbf{s}{t}\\right)} \\Bigg\\lbrace \\frac{1}{\\lambda(a_{jt}) - \\log(\\beta)} \\Bigg( \\pi_{j}^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}} (a_{jt}, \\mathbf{s}{t} ; \\theta^\\pi ) + \\lambda(a{jt}) \\mathbb E_{\\boldsymbol s_{t+1}} \\Big[ V_{j}^{\\boldsymbol P_{-j}} \\left(\\mathbf{s}{t+1}\\right) \\ \\Big| \\ a{jt}, \\boldsymbol s_{t} ; \\theta^f \\Big] \\Bigg) \\Bigg\\rbrace $$\n $\\lambda(a_{jt}) = \\delta + \\frac{\\alpha a_{jt}}{1 + \\alpha a_{jt}}$ is the hazard rate for firm $j$ that something happens  i.e. either an increase in quality, with probability $\\frac{\\alpha a_{jt}}{1 + \\alpha a_{jt}}$ … or a decrease in quality with probability $\\delta$    Computational gain\n Now the expectation over future states $\\mathbb E_{\\boldsymbol s_{t+1}}$ is over $2J$ points instead of $3^J$  3 because quality can go up, down or stay the same 2 because in continuous time we don’t care if the state does not change (investment fails)    Comparison Which method is best?\nI compare them in Courthoud (2020)\n Fastest: Weintraub, Benkard, and Van Roy (2008)  Effectively transforms the game into single-agent dynamics   Best trade-off: Doraszelski and Judd (2019)  Simple, practical and also helps in terms of equilibrium multeplicity   Also in Courthoud (2020): games with random order  Better approximation than Doraszelski and Judd (2019) And similar similar time    Applications Some applications of these methods include\n Approximation methods  Sweeting (2013): product repositioning among radio stations Barwick and Pathak (2015): entry and exit in the real estate brokerage industry   Oblivious equilibrium  Xu and Chen (2020): R\u0026amp;D investment in the Korean electric motor industry   Moment based equilibrium  Jeon (2020): demand learning in the container shipping industry Caoui (2019): technology adoption with network effects in the movie industry Vreugdenhil (2020): search and matching in the oil drilling industry   Games in continuous time  Arcidiacono et al.

procedure for\n regression functions $\\mathbb E [y|x ] = g (x)$ and density functions $f(x)$.  You want to let your data to tell you how flexible you can afford to be in terms of estimation procedures. Non-parametric regression is naturally introduced in terms of fitting a curve.\nConsider the problem of estimating the Conditional Expectation Function, defined as $\\mathbb E [y_i |x_i ] = g(x_i)$ given data $D = (x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n$ under minimal assumption of $g(\\cdot)$, e.g. smoothness. There are two main methods:\n Local methods: Kernel-based estimation Global methods: Series-based estimation  Another way of looking at non-parametrics is to do estimation/inference without specifying functional forms. With no assumptions, informative inference is impossible. Non parametrics tries to work with functional restrictions—continuity, differentiability, etc.—rather than pre-specifying functional form.\nDiscrete x - Cell Estimator Suppose that $x$ can take $R$ distinct values, e.g. gender $R=2$, years of schooling $R=20$, gender $\\times$ years of schooling $R = 2 \\times 20$.\nA simple way for estimating $\\mathbb E \\left[ y |x \\right] = g(x)$ is to split the sample to include observations with $x_i = x$ and calculate the sample mean of $\\bar{y}$ for these observations. Note that this requires no assumptions about how $\\mathbb E [y_i |x_i]$ varies with $x$ since we fit a different value for each value $x$. $$ \\hat{g}(x) = \\frac{1}{| i: x_i = x |} \\sum_{i : x_i = x} y_i $$\nIssues:\n Curse of dimensionality: if $R$ is big compared to $n$, there will be only a small number of observations per $x$ values. If $x_i$ is continuous, $R=n$ with probability 1. Solution: we can borrow information about $g_0(x)$ using neighboring observations of $x$. Averaging for each separate $x_r$ value is only feasible in cases where $x_i$ is coarsely discrete.  Local Non-Parametric Estimation Kernels Suppose we believe that $\\mathbb E [y_i |x_i]$ is a smooth function of $x_i$ – e.g. continuous, differentiable, etc. Then it should not change too much across values of $x$ that are close to each other: we can estimate the conditional expectation at $x = \\bar{x}$ by averaging $y$’s over the values of $x$ that are “close”” to $\\bar{x}$. This procedure relies on two (three) arbitrary choices:\n Choice of the kernel function $K (\\cdot)$; it is used to weight “far out”” observations, such that  $K: \\mathbb R \\to \\mathbb R$ $K$ is symmetric: $K(\\bar{x} + x_i) = K(\\bar{x} - x_i)$ $\\lim_{x_i \\to \\infty}K(x_i - \\bar{x}) = 0$   Choice of the bandwidth $h$: it measures the size of a ``small’’ window around $\\bar{x}$, e.g. $(\\bar{x} - h, \\bar{x} + h)$. Choice of the local estimation procedure. Examples are locally constant, a.k.a. Nadaraya-Watson (NW), and locally linear (LL).   Generally, the choice of $h$ is more important than $K(\\cdot)$ in low dimensional settings.\n Optimal h We need to define what is an “optimal” $h$, depending on the smoothness level of $g_0$, typically unknown. The choice of $h$ relates to the bias-variance trade-off:\n large $h$: small variance, higher bias; small $h$: high variance, smaller bias.   Note that $K_h (\\cdot) = K (\\cdot / h)$.\n Locally Constant Estimator  Nadaraya-Watson estimator, or locally constant estimator. It assumes the CEF locally takes the form $g(x) = \\beta_0(x)$. The local parameter is estimated as: $$ \\hat{\\beta}0 (\\bar{x}) = \\arg\\min{\\beta_0} \\quad \\mathbb E_n \\Big[ K_h (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\cdot \\big(y_i - \\beta_0 \\big)^2 \\Big] $$  CEF The Nadaraya-Watson estimate of the CEF takes the form: $$ \\mathbb E_n \\left[ y | x = \\bar{x}\\right] = \\hat{g}(\\bar{x}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i K_h (x_i - \\bar{x})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n K_h (x_i - \\bar{x})} $$\nLocally Linear Estimator  Local Linear estimator. It assumes the CEF locally takes the form $g(x) = \\beta_0(x) + \\beta_1(x) x$. The local parameters are estimated as:  $$ \\left( \\hat{\\beta}_0 (\\bar{x}), \\hat{\\beta}1 (\\bar{x}) \\right) = \\arg\\min{\\beta_0, \\beta_1} \\quad \\mathbb E_n \\Big[ K_h (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\cdot \\big(y_i - \\beta_0 - (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\beta_1 \\big)^2 \\Big] $$\nCEF In this case, we do LS estimate with $i$’s contribution of residual weighted by the kernel $K_h (x_i - \\bar{x})$. The final estimate at $\\bar{x}$ is given by: $$ \\hat{g} (\\bar{x}) = \\hat{\\beta}_0 (\\bar{x}) + (\\bar{x} - \\bar{x}) \\hat{\\beta}_1 (\\bar{x}) = \\hat{\\beta}_0 (\\bar{x}) $$ since we have centered the $x_s$ at $\\bar{x}$ in the kernel. - It is possible to add linearly higher order polynomials, e.g. do locally quadratic least squares using loss function:\n$$ \\mathbb E_n \\left[ K_h (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\big(y_i - \\beta_0 - (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\beta_1 - (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\beta_2 \\big)^2 \\right] $$\nUniform Kernel LS restricted to sample $i$ such that $x_i$ within $h$ of $\\bar{x}$. $$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; K (\\cdot) = \\mathbb I\\lbrace \\cdot \\in [-1, 1] \\rbrace \\newline \u0026amp; K_h (\\cdot) = \\mathbb I\\lbrace \\cdot/h \\in [-1, 1] \\rbrace = \\mathbb I\\lbrace \\cdot \\in [-h, h] \\rbrace \\newline \u0026amp; K_h (x_i - \\bar{x}) = \\mathbb I\\lbrace x_i - \\bar{x} \\in [-h, h] \\rbrace = \\mathbb I\\lbrace x_i \\in [\\bar{x}-h, \\bar{x} + h] \\rbrace \\end{aligned} $$ Employed together with the locally linear estimator, the estimation procedure reduces to **local least squares}. The loss function is: $$ \\mathbb E_n \\Big[ K_n (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\big(y_i -\\beta_0 - \\beta_1 (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\big)^2 \\Big] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i: x_i \\in [\\bar{x}-h, \\bar{x} +h ]} \\big(y_i -\\beta_0 - \\beta_1 (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\big)^2 $$\nThe more local is the estimation, the more appropriate the linear regression: if $g_0$ is smooth, $g_0(\\bar{x}) + g_0'(\\bar{x}) (x_i - \\bar{x})$ is a better approximation for $g_0 (x_i)$.\nHowever, the uniform density is not a good kernel choice as it produces discontinuous CEF estimates. The following are two popular alternative choices that produce continuous CEF estimates.\nOther Kernels   Epanechnikov kernel $$ K_h(x_i - \\bar{x}) = \\frac { 3 } { 4 } \\left( 1 - (x_i - \\bar{x}) ^ { 2 } \\right) \\mathbb I\\lbrace x_i \\in [\\bar{x}-h, \\bar{x} + h] \\rbrace $$\n  Normal or Gaussian kernel $$ K_\\phi (x_i - \\bar{x}) = \\frac { 1 } { \\sqrt { 2 \\pi } } \\exp \\left( - \\frac { (x_i - \\bar{x}) ^ { 2 } } { 2 } \\right) $$\n  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): choose bandwidth so that there is a fixed number of observations in each kernel. This kernel is different from the others since it takes a nonparamentric form.\n  Example Choice of the optimal bandwidth Practical methods:\n  Eyeball Method. (i) Choose a bandwidth (ii) Estimate the regression function (iii) Look at the result: if it looks more wiggly than you would like, increase the bandwidth: if it looks more smooth than you would like, decrease the bandwidth. Con: It only works for $\\dim(x_i) = 1$ or $2$.\n  Rule of Thumb. For example, Silverman’s rule of thumb: $h = \\left( \\frac{4 \\hat{\\sigma}^5}{3n} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{5}}$. Con: It requires too much knowledge about $g_0$ (i.e. normality) which you don’t have.\n  Cross Validation. Under some assumptions, CV will approximately gives the MSE optimal bandwidth. The basic idea is to evaluate quality of the bandwidth by looking at how well the resulting estimator forecasts in the given sample.\n  Leave-one-out CV. For each $h \u0026gt; 0$ and each $i$, $\\hat{g}{-i} (x_i)$ is the estimate of the conditional expectation at $x_i$ using bandwidth $h$ and all observations expect observation $i$. The CV bandwidth is defined as $$ \\hat{h} = \\arg \\min_h CV(h) = \\arg \\min_h \\sum{i=1}^n \\Big( y_i - \\hat{g}_{-i} (x_i) \\Big)^2 $$\nPractical Tips  Select a value for $h$. For each observation $i$, calculate $$ \\hat{g}{-i} (x_i) = \\frac{\\sum{j \\ne i} y_j K_h (x_j - x_i) }{\\sum_{i=1}^n K_h (x_j - x_i)}, \\qquad e_{i,h}^2 = \\left(y_i - \\hat{g}_{-i} (x_i) \\right)^2 $$ Calculate $\\text{CV}(h) = \\sum_{i=1}^n e^2_{i,h}$. Repeat for each $h$ and choose the one that minimizes $\\text{CV}(h)$.  Inference Theorem: Consider data $\\lbrace y_i, x_i \\rbrace_{i=1}^n$, iid and suppose that $y_i = g(x_i) + \\varepsilon_i$ where $\\mathbb E[\\varepsilon_i|x_i] = 0$. Assume that $x_i \\in Interior(X)$ where $X \\subseteq \\mathbb R$, $g(x)$ and $f(x)$ are three times continuously differentiable, and $f(x) \u0026gt; 0$ on $X$. $f(x)$ is the probability density of $x \\in X$ , and $g(x)$ is the function of interest. Suppose that $K(\\cdot)$ is a kernel function. Suppose $n\\to\\infty$, $h\\to0$ , $nh\\to\\infty$, and $nh^7\\to0$. Then for any fixed $x\\in X$, $$ AMSE = \\sqrt{nh} \\Big( \\hat{g}(x) - g(x) - h^2 B(x)\\Big) \\overset{d}{\\to} N \\left( 0, \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma^2(x)}{f(x)}\\right) $$ for $\\sigma^2(x) = Var(y_i|x_i = x)$, $\\kappa = \\int K^2(v)dv$, and $B(x) = \\frac{\\kappa_2}{2} \\frac{f'(x)g'(x) + f(x) g''(x)}{f(x)}$ where $\\kappa_2 = \\int v^2 K(v)dv$.\nRemarks  If the function is smooth enough and the bandwidth small enough, you can ignore the bias relative to sampling variation. To make this plausible, use a smaller bandwidth than would be the “optimal”. All kernel regression estimators can be written as a weighted average $$ \\hat{g}(x) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i (x) y_i, \\quad \\text{ with } \\quad w_i (x) = \\frac{n K_h (x_i - x)}{\\sum_{i=1}^n K_h (x_i - x)} $$ Do inference as if you were estimating a mean $\\mathbb E[z_i]$ with sample mean $\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n z_i$ using $z_i = w_i (x) y_i$. If you are doing inference at more than one value of $x$, do inference as in the previous point, treating each value of $x$ as a different sample mean and note that even with independent data, these means will be correlated in general because there will generally be some common observations in to each of the averages. If you have a time series, make sure you account for correlation between the observations going in the different averages even if they don’t overlap.  Issue when doing inference: the estimation of the bandwidth from the data is generally not accounted for in the distributional approximation (when doing inference). In large-samples, this is unlikely to lead to large changes, but uncertainty is understated in small samples.\nBias-Variance Trade-off Theorem\nFor any estimator mean-square error MSE is decomposable into variance and bias-squared: $$ \\text{MSE} (\\bar{x}, \\hat{g}) = \\mathbb E \\left[ \\left( \\hat{g}(\\bar{x}) - g_0 (\\bar{x}) \\right)^2 \\right] = \\mathbb E \\Big[\\underbrace{ \\hat{g}(\\bar{x}) - g_0 (\\bar{x}) }_{\\text{Bias}} \\Big]^2 + Var (\\hat{g} (\\bar{x})). $$\nProof The theorem follows from the following corollary.\nCorollary\nLet $A$ be a random variable and $\\theta_0$ a fixed parameter. Then, $$ \\mathbb E [ (A - \\theta_0)^2] = Var (A) + \\mathbb E [A-\\theta_0]^2 $$\nProof $$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb E [ (A - \\theta_0)^2] \u0026amp; = \\mathbb E[A^2] - 2 \\mathbb E [A \\theta_0] + \\mathbb E [\\theta_0] \\newline \u0026amp; = \\mathbb E[A^2] \\underbrace{- \\mathbb E[A]^2 + E[A]^2}_{\\text{add and subtract}} - 2 \\mathbb E [A \\theta_0] + \\mathbb E [\\theta_0] \\newline \u0026amp; = Var(A) + \\mathbb E [A]^2 - 2 \\theta_0 \\mathbb E [A ] + \\mathbb E [\\theta_0] \\newline \u0026amp; = Var(A) + \\mathbb E [A - \\theta_0]^2 \\end{aligned} $$\nNote that $\\mathbb E [ (A - \\theta_0)^2] = \\mathbb E [A - \\theta_0]^2$. $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nCriteria Which criteria should we use with non-parametric estimators?\n  Mean squared error (MSE): $$ \\text{MSE} (\\bar{x}) (\\hat{g}) = \\mathbb E \\left[ \\left( \\hat{g}(\\bar{x}) - g_0 (\\bar{x}) \\right)^2 \\right] $$ NB! This is the criterium we are going to use.\n  Integrated mean squared error (IMSE): $$ \\text{IMSE} ( \\hat{g} ) = \\mathbb E \\left[ \\int | \\hat{g} (x) - g_0 (x) |^2 \\mathrm{d} F(x) \\right] $$\n  Type I - Type II error.\n  Comments Hansen (2019): the theorem above implies that we can asymptotically approximate the MSE as $$ \\text{AMSE} = \\Big( h^2 \\sigma_k^2 B(x) \\Big)^2 + \\frac{\\kappa \\sigma^2(x)}{nh f(x)} \\approx \\text{const} \\cdot \\left( h^4 + \\frac{1}{n h} \\right) $$\nWhere\n $Var \\propto \\frac{1}{h n}$, where you can think of $n h$ as the effective sample size. Bias $\\propto h^2$, derived if $g_0$ is twice continuously differentiable using Taylor expansion.  Trade-Off The asymptotic MSE is dominated by the larger of $h^4$ and $\\frac{1}{h n}$. Notice that the bias is increasing in $h$ and the variance is decreasing in $h$ (more smoothing means more observations are used for local estimation: this increases the bias but decreases estimation variance). To select $h$ to minimize the asymptotic MSE, these two components should balance each other: $$ \\frac{1}{h n} \\propto h^4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad h \\propto n^{-1/5} $$\nThis result means that the bandwidth should take the form $h = c \\cdot n^{-1/5}$. The optimal constant $c$ depends on the kernel $k$ the bias function $B(x)$ and the marginal density $f_x(x)$. A common misinterpretation is to set $h = n^{-1/5}$ which is equivalent to setting $c = 1$ and is completely arbitrary. Instead, an empirical bandwidth selection rule such as cross-validation should be used in practice.\nGlobal Non-Parametric Estimation Series The goal is to try to globally approximate the CEF with a function $g(x)$. Series methods are based on the Stone-Weierstrass theorem: a real-valued continuous function $g(x)$ defined in a compact set can be approximated with polynomials for any degree of accuracy $$ g_0 (x) = p_1 (x) \\beta _1 + \\dots + p_K (x) \\beta_K + r(x) $$ where $p_1(x), \\dots, p_K(x)$ are called ``a dictionary of approximating series’’ and $r(x)$ is a remainder function. If $p_1(x), \\dots, p_K(x)$ are sufficiently rich, $r(x)$ will be small. If $K \\to \\infty$, then $r \\to 0$.\n Example - Taylor series: if $g(x)$ is infinitely differentiable, then $$ g(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } a_k x^k $$ where $a_k = \\frac{1}{k!} \\frac{\\partial^k g_0}{\\partial x^k}$.\n In Practice The basic idea is to approximate the infinite sum by chopping it off after $K$ terms and then estimate the coefficients by OLS.\nSeries estimation:\n Choose $K$, i.e. the number of series terms, and an approximating dictionary $p_1(x), \\dots, p_K(x)$ Expand data to $D = \\left( y_i, p_1(x_i), \\dots, p_K(x_i) \\right)_{i=1}^n$ Estimate OLS to get $\\hat{\\beta}_1, \\dots, \\hat{\\beta}_K$ Set $\\hat{g}(x) = p_1 (x)\\hat{\\beta}_1 + \\dots + p_K(x) \\hat{\\beta}_K$  Examples   Monomials: $p_1(x) = 1, p_2(x) = x, p_3(x)=x^2, \\dots$\n  Hermite Polynomials: $p_1(x) = 1$, $p_2(x) = x$, $p_3(x)=x^2 -1$, $p_4(x)= x^3 - 3x, \\dots$. Con: edge effects. The estimated function is particularly volatile at the edges of the sample space (Gibbs effect)\n  Trig Polynomials: $p_1(x) = 1$, $p_2(x) = \\cos 2 \\pi x$, $p_3(x)= \\sin 2 \\pi x$, $p_4(x) = \\cos 2 \\pi x \\cdot 2 x \\dots$. Pro: cyclical therefore good for series. Con: edge effects\n  B-splines: recursively constructed using knot points $$ B_{i, 0} = \\begin{cases} 1 \u0026amp; \\text{if } t_i \\leq x \u0026lt; t_{i+1} \\newline 0 \u0026amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\qquad B_{i_k} (x) = \\frac{x - t_i}{ t_{i+k} - t_i} B_{i, k-1} (x) + \\frac{t_{i+k+1}-x}{t_{i+k+1} - t_{i+1}} B_{i+1, k-1} (x) $$ where $t_0, \\dots, t_i, \\dots$ are knot points and $k$ is the order of the spline. Pro: faster rate of convergence and lower asymptotic bias.\n  Hermite Polynomials Estimation Given $K$, inference proceeds exactly as if one had run an OLS of $y$ on $(p_k)_{k=1}^K$. The idea is that you ignore that you are doing non-parametric regression as long as you believe you have put enough terms (high $K$). Then the function is smooth enough so that the bias of the approximation is small relative to the variance (see Newey, 1997). Note that his approximation does not account for data-dependent estimation of the bandwidth.\nConsistency Newey (1997): results about consistency of $\\hat{g}$ and asymptotic normality of $\\hat{g}$.\n OLS: $\\hat{\\beta} \\overset{p}{\\to} \\beta_0$ Non-parametric: you have a sequence $\\lbrace\\beta_k\\rbrace_{k=1}^K$ with $\\hat{\\beta}_k \\overset{p}{\\to} \\beta_k$ as $n \\to \\infty$ (as $k \\to \\infty$). However, this does not make sense because $\\lbrace\\beta_k\\rbrace$ is not constant. Moreover, $\\beta_k$ is not the quantity of interest. We want to make inference on $\\hat{g}(x)$.  Theorem\nUnder regularity conditions, including $| | \\hat{\\beta} - \\beta_0 | | \\overset{p}{\\to} 0$,\n Uniform Consistency: $\\sup_x | \\hat{g}(x) - g_0(x)| \\overset{p}{\\to} 0$ Mean-square Consistency: $\\int | \\hat{g}(x) - g_0(x)|^2 \\mathrm{d} F(x) \\overset{p}{\\to} 0$  IMSE Theorem\nUnder the following assumptions:\n $(x_i, y_i)$ are iid and $Var(y_i|x_i)$ is bounded; For all $K$, there exists a non-singular matrix $B$ such that $A = \\left[ (B p(x)) (B p(x))' \\right]$ where $p(x) = \\left( p_1(x), \\dots, p_K (x) \\right)$ has the properties that $\\lambda_{\\min} (A)^{-1} = O(1)$. In addition, $\\sup_x | | B p(x) | | = o(\\sqrt{K/n})$. There exists $\\alpha$ and $\\beta_K$ for all $K$ such that $$ \\sup_x | g_0 (x) - p(x) \\beta_K | = O_p(K^{-\\alpha}) $$  Then, it holds that\n$$ \\text{IMSE = }\\int \\left( g_0 (x) - \\hat{g} (x) \\right)^2 \\mathrm{d} F(x) = O_p \\left( \\frac{K}{n} + K^{-2\\alpha}\\right) $$\nChoice of the optimal $K$ The bias-variance trade-off for series comes in through the choice of $K$:\n Higher $K$: smaller bias, since we are leaving out less terms form the infinite sum. Smaller $K$: smaller variance, since we are estimating less regression coefficients from the same amount of data.  Cross-validation for series: For each $K \\geq 0$ and for each $i=1, \\dots, n$, consider\n$$ D_{-i} = \\lbrace (x_1, y_1), \\dots, (x_{i-1}, y_{i-1}),(x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}), \\dots (x_n, y_n) \\rbrace $$ and calculate $\\hat{g}^{(K)}_{-i} (x)$ using series estimate with $p_1(x), \\dots, p_K (x)$ in order to get $e^{(K)}i = y_i - \\hat{g}^{(K)}{-i} (x_i)$. Choose $\\hat{K}$ such that\n$$ \\hat{K} = \\arg \\min_K \\mathbb E_n \\left[ {e^{(K)}_i}^2 \\right] $$\nInference Consider the data $D = \\lbrace (x_i, y_i) \\rbrace_{i=1}^n$ such that $y_i = g_0 (x_i) + \\varepsilon_i$. You may want to form confidence intervals for quantities that depends on $g_0$.\n Example: $\\theta_0$ functional forms of interests:\n Point estimate: $\\theta_0 = g_0 (\\bar{x} )$ for fixed $\\bar{x}$ Interval estimate: $\\theta_0 = g_0 (\\bar{x}_2) - g_0 (\\bar{x}_1)$ Point derivative estimate: $\\theta_0 = g_0 ' (\\bar{x})$ at $\\bar{x}$ Average derivative $\\theta_0 = \\mathbb E [g_0 ' (x) ]$ Consumer surplus: $\\theta_0 = \\int_a^b g_0(x)dx \\quad$ when $g_0$ is a demand function.   Those estimates are functionals: maps from a function to a real number. We are doing inference on a function now, not on a point estimate.\nInference In order to form a confidence interval for $\\theta_0$, with series you can\n Undersmooth: in order to apply a \\textit{central limit theorem}{=tex}, you need deviations around the function to be approximately gaussian. Undersmoothing makes the function oscillate much more than the curve you are estimating in order to obtain such guassian deviations. Use the delta method. It would usually require more series terms than a criterion like cross-validation would suggest.  Undersmoothing If on the contrary you oversmooth (e.g. $g_0$ linear), errors are going to constantly be on either one or the other side of the curve $\\to$ not gaussian!\nDelta Method Theorem: Under the assumptions of the consistency theorem $$ \\frac{\\sqrt{n} \\Big(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0 + B(r_K) \\Big)}{\\sqrt{v_K}} \\overset{d}{\\to} N (0,1) $$\nTheorem: Under the assumptions of the consistency theorem and $\\sqrt{n} K^{-\\alpha} = o(1)$ (or equivalently $n K^{-2\\alpha} = O(1)$ in Hansen), $$ \\frac{\\sqrt{n} \\Big(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0 \\Big)}{\\sqrt{v_K}} \\overset{d}{\\to} N (0,1) $$\nRemark  The rate of convergence of splines is faster than for power series (Newey 1997). We have undersmoothing if $\\sqrt{n} K^{\\alpha} = o(1)$ (see comment below) Usually, in order to prove asymptotic normality, we first prove unbiasedness. However here we have a biased estimator but we make the bias converge to zero faster than the variance.  Hansen (2019): The critical condition is the assumption that $\\sqrt{n} K^{\\alpha} = o(1)$ This requires that $K \\to \\infty$ at a rate faster than $n^{\\frac{1}{2\\alpha}}$ This is a troubling condition. The optimal rate for estimation of $g(x)$ is $K = O(n^{\\frac{1}{1+ 2\\alpha}})$. If we set $K = n^{\\frac{1}{1+ 2\\alpha}}$ by this rule then $n K^{-2\\alpha} = n^{\\frac{1}{1+ 2\\alpha}} \\to \\infty$ not zero. Thus this assumption is equivalent to assuming that $K$ is much larger than optimal. The reason why this trick works (that is, why the bias is negligible) is that by increasing $K$ the asymptotic bias decreases and the asymptotic variance increases and thus the variance dominates. Because $K$ is larger than optimal, we typically say that $\\hat{g}(x)$ is undersmoothed relative to the optimal series estimator.\nMore Remarks  Many authors like to focus their asymptotic theory on the assumptions in the theorem, as the distribution of $\\theta$ appears cleaner. However, it is a poor use of asymptotic theory. There are three problems with the assumption $\\sqrt{n} K^{-\\alpha} = o(1)$ and the approximation of the theorem.\n First, it says that if we intentionally pick $K$ to be larger than optimal, we can increase the estimation variance relative to the bias so the variance will dominate the bias. But why would we want to intentionally use an estimator which is sub-optimal? Second, the assumption $\\sqrt{n} K^{-\\alpha} = o(1)$ does not eliminate the asymptotic bias, it only makes it of lower order than the variance. So the approximation of the theorem is technically valid, but the missing asymptotic bias term is just slightly smaller in asymptotic order, and thus still relevant in finite samples. Third, the condition $\\sqrt{n} K^{\\alpha} = o(1)$ is just an assumption, it has nothing to do with actual empirical practice. Thus the difference between the two theorems is in the assumptions, not in the actual reality or in the actual empirical practice. Eliminating a nuisance (the asymptotic bias) through an assumption is a trick, not a substantive use of theory. My strong view is that the result (1) is more informative than (2). It shows that the asymptotic distribution is normal but has a non-trivial finite sample bias.   Kernel vs Series Hansen (2019): in this and the previous chapter we have presented two distinct methods of nonparametric regression based on kernel methods and series methods. Which should be used in practice? Both methods have advantages and disadvantages and there is no clear overall winner.\nFirst, while the asymptotic theory of the two estimators appear quite different, they are actually rather closely related. When the regression function $g(x)$ is twice differentiable $(s = 2)$ then the rate of convergence of both the MSE of the kernel regression estimator with optimal bandwidth $h$ and the series estimator with optimal $K$ is $n^{-\\frac{2}{k+4}}$ (where $k = \\dim(x)$). There is no difference. If the regression function is smoother than twice differentiable ($s \u0026gt; 2$) then the rate of the convergence of the series estimator improves. This may appear to be an advantage for series methods, but kernel regression can also take advantage of the higher smoothness by using so-called higher-order kernels or local polynomial regression, so perhaps this advantage is not too large.\nBoth estimators are asymptotically normal and have straightforward asymptotic standard error formulae. The series estimators are a bit more convenient for this purpose, as classic parametric standard error formula work without amendment.\nAdvantages of Kernels An advantage of kernel methods is that their distributional theory is easier to derive. The theory is all based on local averages which is relatively straightforward. In contrast, series theory is more challenging, dealing with increasing parameter spaces. An important difference in the theory is that for kernel estimators we have explicit representations for the bias while we only have rates for series methods. This means that plug-in methods can be used for bandwidth selection in kernel regression. However, typically we rely on cross-validation, which is equally applicable in both kernel and series regression.\nKernel methods are also relatively easy to implement when the dimension of $x$, $k$, is large. There is not a major change in the methodology as $k$ increases. In contrast, series methods become quite cumbersome as $k$ increases as the number of cross-terms increases exponentially. E.g ($K=2$) with $k=1$ you have only $\\lbrace x_1, x_1^2\\rbrace$; with $k=2$ you have to add $\\lbrace x_2, x_2^2, x_1 x_2 \\rbrace$; with $k=3$ you have to add $\\lbrace x_3, x_3^2, x_1 x_3, x_2 x_3\\rbrace$, etc..\nAdvantages of Series A major advantage of series methods is that it has inherently a high degree of flexibility, and the user is able to implement shape restrictions quite easily. For example, in series estimation it is relatively simple to implement a partial linear CEF, an additively separable CEF, monotonicity, concavity or convexity. These restrictions are harder to implement in kernel regression.\n","date":1635465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635465600,"objectID":"486b7a0f83ad926dab18785e2fbd49e6","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/metrics/08_nonparametric/","publishdate":"2021-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/metrics/08_nonparametric/","section":"course","summary":"Introduction Non-parametric regression is a flexible estimation procedure for\n regression functions $\\mathbb E [y|x ] = g (x)$ and density functions $f(x)$.

Suppose further that $\\mathbb E[x_i] = 0$, $\\mathbb E[z_i] = 0$, $\\mathbb E[\\varepsilon_i |x_i,z_i] = 0$. Then, unless $\\beta_0 = 0$ or $z_i$ is orthogonal to $x_i$, the (sole) stochastic regressor $x_i$ is correlated with the error term in the short regression which implies that the OLS estimator of the short regression is inconsistent for $\\alpha_0$ due to the omitted variable bias. In particular, one can show that the plim of the OLS estimator of $\\hat{\\alpha}_{SHORT}$ from the short regression is\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha}_{SHORT} \\overset{p}{\\to} \\frac{Cov(y_i, x_i)}{Var(x_i)} = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_0 \\frac{Cov(z_i, x_i)}{Var(x_i)} $$\nConsider data $D= (y_i, x_i, z_i)_{i=1}^n$, where the true model is:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; y_i = x_i' \\alpha_0 + z_i' \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i \\ \u0026amp; x_i = z_i' \\gamma_0 + u_i \\end{aligned} $$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s investigate the Omitted Variable Bias by simulation.

Re-run the new \u0026ldquo;model\u0026rdquo; using $(x_i, z_{\\hat{T},i})$ (i.e. using the selected covariates with statistically significant coefficients). Perform statistical inference (i.e. confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) as if no model selection had been done.  Pre-testing leads to incorrect inference. Why?

Pre-testing is not a problem in 3 cases:\n  when $\\beta_0$ is very large: in this case the test always rejects the null hypothesis $H_0 : \\beta_0=0$ and we always run the correct specification, i.e. the long regression\n  when $\\beta_0$ is very small: in this case the test has very little power. However, as we saw from the Omitted Variable Bias formula, the bias is small.\n  when $\\gamma_0$ is very small: also in this case the test has very little power. However, as we saw from the Omitted Variable Bias formula, the bias is small.\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s compare the pre-test estimates for different values of the true parameter $\\beta$.\n# Case 1: different betas and same sample size b_sequence = b*np.array([0.1,0.3,1,3]) alpha = {} # Get sequence for k, b_ in enumerate(b_sequence): label = 'beta = %.2f' % b_ alpha[label] = pre_testing(a, b_, c, n)['Pre-test'] print('Mean alpha with beta=%.2f: %.4f' % (b_, np.mean(alpha[label])))  Mean alpha with beta=-0.03: 0.9926 Mean alpha with beta=-0.09: 0.9826 Mean alpha with beta=-0.30: 0.9925 Mean alpha with beta=-0.90: 0.9994  The means are similar, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at the distributions.\n# Plot plot_alpha(alpha, a)  When $\\beta_0$ is \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo;, the distribution of the pre-testing estimator for $\\alpha$ is not normal.\nHowever, the magnitue of $\\beta_0$ is a relative concept. For an infinite sample size, $\\beta_0$ is always going to be \u0026ldquo;big enough\u0026rdquo;, in the sense that with an infinite sample size the probability fo false positives in testing $H_0: \\beta_0 = 0$ is going to zero. I.e. we always select the correct model specification, the long regression.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the distibution of $\\hat \\alpha_{\\text{PRE-TEST}}$ when the sample size increaes.\n# Case 2: same beta and different sample sizes n_sequence = [100,300,1000,3000] alpha = {} # Get sequence for k, n_ in enumerate(n_sequence): label = 'n = %.0f' % n_ alpha[label] = pre_testing(a, b, c, n_)['Pre-test'] print('Mean alpha with n=%.0f: %.4f' % (n_, np.mean(alpha[label])))  Mean alpha with n=100: 0.9442 Mean alpha with n=300: 0.9635 Mean alpha with n=1000: 0.9925 Mean alpha with n=3000: 0.9989  # Plot plot_alpha(alpha, a)  As we can see, for large samples, $\\beta_0$ is never \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo;. In the limit, when $n \\to \\infty$, the probability of false positives while testing $H_0: \\beta_0 = 0$ goes to zero.\nWe face a dilemma:\n pre-testing is clearlly a problem in finite samples all our econometric results are based on the assumption that $n \\to \\infty$  The problem is solved by assuming that the value of $\\beta_0$ depends on the sample size. This might seems like a weird assumption but is just to have an asymptotically meaningful concept of \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo;.\nWe now look at what happens in the simulations when $\\beta_0$ is proportional to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n# Case 3: beta proportional to 1/sqrt(n) and different sample sizes beta = b * 30 / np.sqrt(n_sequence) # Get sequence alpha = {} for k, n_ in enumerate(n_sequence): label = 'n = %.0f' % n_ alpha[label] = pre_testing(a, beta[k], c, n_)['Pre-test'] print('Mean alpha with n=%.0f: %.4f' % (n_, np.mean(alpha[label])))  Mean alpha with n=100: 0.9703 Mean alpha with n=300: 0.9838 Mean alpha with n=1000: 0.9914 Mean alpha with n=3000: 0.9947  # Plot plot_alpha(alpha, a)  Now the distribution of $\\hat \\alpha$ does not converge to a normal when the sample size increases.\nPre-Testing and Machine Learning How are machine learning and pre-testing related? The best example is Lasso. Suppose you have a dataset with many variables. This means that you have very few degrees of freedom and your OLS estimates are going to be very imprecise. At the extreme, you have more variables than observations so that your OLS coefficient is undefined since you cannot invert the design matrix $X\u0026rsquo;X$.\nIn this case, you might want to do variable selection. One way of doing variable selection is pre-testing. Another way is Lasso. A third alternative is to use machine learning methods that do not suffer this curse of dimensionality.\nThe purpose and outcome of pre-testing and Lasso are the same:\n you have too many variables you exclude some of them from the regression / set their coefficients to zero  As a consequence, also the problems are the same, i.e. pre-test bias.\n9.4 Post-Double Selection Consider again data $D= (y_i, x_i, z_i)_{i=1}^n$, where the true model is:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; y_i = x_i' \\alpha_0 + z_i' \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i \\ \u0026amp; x_i = z_i' \\gamma_0 + u_i \\end{aligned} $$\nWe would like to guard against pretest bias if possible, in order to handle high dimensional models. A good pathway towards motivating procedures which guard against pretest bias is a discussion of classical partitioned regression.\nConsider a regression $y_i$ on $x_i$ and $z_i$. $x_i$ is the 1-dimensional variable of interest, $z_i$ is a high-dimensional set of control variables. We have the following procedure:\n First Stage selection: regress $x_i$ on $z_i$. Select the statistically significant variables in the set $S_{FS} \\subseteq z_i$ Reduced Form selection: lasso $y_i$ on $z_i$. Select the statistically significant variables in the set $S_{RF} \\subseteq z_i$ Regress $y_i$ on $x_i$ and $S_{FS} \\cup S_{RF}$  Theorem: Let ${P^n}$ be a sequence of data-generating processes for $D_n = (y_i, x_i, z_i)^n_{i=1} \\in (\\mathbb R \\times \\mathbb R \\times \\mathbb R^p) ^n$ where $p$ depends on $n$. For each $n$, the data are iid with $yi = x_i'\\alpha_0^{(n)} + z_i' \\beta_0^{(n)} + \\varepsilon_i$ and $x_i = z_i' \\gamma_0^{(n)} + u_i$ where $\\mathbb E[\\varepsilon_i | x_i,z_i] = 0$ and $\\mathbb E[u_i|z_i] = 0$. The sparsity of the vectors $\\beta_0^{(n)}$, $\\gamma_0^{(n)}$ is controlled by $|| \\beta_0^{(n)} ||_0 \\leq s$ with $s^2 (\\log p)^2/n \\to 0$. Suppose that additional regularity conditions on the model selection procedures and moments of the random variables $y_i$ , $x_i$ , $z_i$ as documented in Belloni et al. (2014). Then the confidence intervals, CI, from the post double selection procedure are uniformly valid. That is, for any confidence level $\\xi \\in (0, 1)$ $$ \\Pr(\\alpha_0 \\in CI) \\to 1- \\xi $$\nIn order to have valid confidence intervals you want their bias to be negligibly. Since $$ CI = \\left[ \\hat{\\alpha} \\pm \\frac{1.96 \\cdot \\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right] $$\nIf the bias is $o \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$ then there is no problem since it is asymptotically negligible w.r.t. the magnitude of the confidence interval. If however the the bias is $O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$ then it has the same magnitude of the confidence interval and it does not asymptotically vanish.\nThe idea of the proof is to use partitioned regression. An alternative way to think about the argument is: bound the omitted variables bias. Omitted variable bias comes from the product of 2 quantities related to the omitted variable:\n Its partial correlation with the outcome, and Its partial correlation with the variable of interest.  If both those partial correlations are $O( \\sqrt{\\log p/n})$, then the omitted variables bias is $(s \\times O( \\sqrt{\\log p/n})^2 = o \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$, provided $s^2 (\\log p)^2/n \\to 0$. Relative to the $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} $ convergence rate, the omitted variables bias is negligible.\nIn our omitted variable bias case, we want $| \\beta_0 \\gamma_0 | = o \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$. Post-double selection guarantees that\n Reduced form selection (pre-testing): any \u0026ldquo;missing\u0026rdquo; variable has $|\\beta_{0j}| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$ First stage selection (additional): any \u0026ldquo;missing\u0026rdquo; variable has $|\\gamma_{0j}| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$  As a consequence, as long as the number of omitted variables is finite, the omitted variable bias is $$ OVB(\\alpha) = |\\beta_{0j}| \\cdot|\\gamma_{0j}| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}} \\cdot \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{c^2}{n} = o \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) $$\n# Pre-testing code def post_double_selection(a, b, c, n, simulations=1000): np.random.seed(1) # Init alpha = {'Long': np.zeros((simulations,1)), 'Short': np.zeros((simulations,1)), 'Pre-test': np.zeros((simulations,1)), 'Post-double': np.zeros((simulations,1))} # Loop over simulations for i in range(simulations): # Generate data x, y, z = generate_data(a, b, c, n) # Compute coefficients xz = np.concatenate([x,z], axis=1) alpha['Long'][i] = (inv(xz.T @ xz) @ xz.T @ y)[0][0] alpha['Short'][i] = inv(x.T @ x) @ x.T @ y # Compute significance of z on y (beta hat) t1 = t_test(y, xz, 1) # Compute significance of z on x (gamma hat) t2 = t_test(x, z, 0) # Select specification based on first test if np.abs(t1)\u0026gt;1.96: alpha['Pre-test'][i] = alpha['Long'][i] else: alpha['Pre-test'][i] = alpha['Short'][i] # Select specification based on both tests if np.abs(t1)\u0026gt;1.96 or np.abs(t2)\u0026gt;1.96: alpha['Post-double'][i] = alpha['Long'][i] else: alpha['Post-double'][i] = alpha['Short'][i] return alpha  Let\u0026rsquo;s now repeat the same exercise as above, but with also post-double selection\n# Get pre_test alpha alpha = post_double_selection(a, b, c, n) for key, value in alpha.items(): print('Mean alpha %s = %.4f' % (key, np.mean(value)))  Mean alpha Long = 0.9994 Mean alpha Short = 0.9095 Mean alpha Pre-test = 0.9925 Mean alpha Post-double = 0.9994  # Plot plot_alpha(alpha, a)  As we can see, post-double selection has solved the pre-testing problem.

Therefore, post-double selection solves the pre-test bias problem in those settings. The post-double selection procedure with Lasso is:\n First Stage selection: lasso $x_i$ on $z_i$.

(2018). \u0026ldquo;Double/debiased machine learning for treatment and structural parameters\u0026quot;.\nConsider the following partially linear model\n$$ y = \\beta_0 D + g_0(X) + u \\ D = m_0(X) + v $$\nwhere $y$ is the outcome variable, $D$ is the treatment to interest and $X$ is a potentially high-dimensional set of controls.\nNaive approach A naive approach to estimation of $\\beta_0$ using ML methods would be, for example, to construct a sophisticated ML estimator $\\beta_0 D + g_0(X)$ for learning the regression function $\\beta_0 D$ + $g_0(X)$.\n Split the sample in two: main sample and auxiliary sample Use the auxiliary sample to estimate $\\hat g_0(X)$ Use the main sample to compute the orthogonalized component of $Y$ on $X$: $\\hat u = \\left(Y_{i}-\\hat{g}{0}\\left(X{i}\\right)\\right)$ Use the main sample to estimate the residualized OLS estimator  $$ \\hat{\\beta}{0}=\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum{i \\in I} D_{i}^{2}\\right)^{-1} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i \\in I} D_{i} \\hat u_i $$\nThis estimator is going to have two problems:\n Slow rate of convergence, i.e. slower than $\\sqrt(n)$ It will be biased because we are employing highdimensional regularized estimators (e.g. we are doing variable selection)  Orthogonalization Now consider a second construction that employs an orthogonalized formulation obtained by directly partialling out the effect of $X$ from $D$ to obtain the orthogonalized regressor $v = D − m_0(X)$.\n  Split the sample in two: main sample and auxiliary sample\n  Use the auxiliary sample to estimate $\\hat g_0(X)$ from\n$$ y = \\beta_0 D + g_0(X) + u \\ $$\n  Use the auxiliary sample to estimate $\\hat m_0(X)$ from\n$$ D = m_0(X) + v $$\n  Use the main sample to compute the orthogonalized component of $D$ on $X$ as\n$$ \\hat v = D - \\hat m_0(X) $$\n  Use the main sample to estimate the double-residualized OLS estimator as\n$$ \\hat{\\beta}{0}=\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum{i \\in I} \\hat v_i D_{i} \\right)^{-1} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i \\in I} \\hat v_i \\left( Y - \\hat g_0(X) \\right) $$\n  The estimator is unbiased but still has a lower rate of convergence because of sample splitting. The problem is solved by inverting the split sample, re-estimating the coefficient and averaging the two estimates. Note that this procedure is valid since the two estimates are independent by the sample splitting procedure.\nApplication to AJR02 In this section we are going to replicate 6.3 of the \u0026ldquo;Double/debiased machine learning\u0026rdquo; paper based on Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson (2002), \u0026ldquo;The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development\u0026quot;.\nWe first load the dataset\n# Load Acemoglu Johnson Robinson Dataset df = pd.read_csv('data/AJR02.csv',index_col=0)  df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  GDP Exprop Mort Latitude Neo Africa Asia Namer Samer logMort Latitude2     1 8.39 6.50 78.20 0.3111 0 1 0 0 0 4.359270 0.096783   2 7.77 5.36 280.00 0.1367 0 1 0 0 0 5.634790 0.018687   3 9.13 6.39 68.90 0.3778 0 0 0 0 1 4.232656 0.142733   4 9.90 9.32 8.55 0.3000 1 0 0 0 0 2.145931 0.090000   5 9.29 7.50 85.00 0.2683 0 0 0 1 0 4.442651 0.071985     df.info()  \u0026lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'\u0026gt; Int64Index: 64 entries, 1 to 64 Data columns (total 11 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype --- ------ -------------- ----- 0 GDP 64 non-null float64 1 Exprop 64 non-null float64 2 Mort 64 non-null float64 3 Latitude 64 non-null float64 4 Neo 64 non-null int64 5 Africa 64 non-null int64 6 Asia 64 non-null int64 7 Namer 64 non-null int64 8 Samer 64 non-null int64 9 logMort 64 non-null float64 10 Latitude2 64 non-null float64 dtypes: float64(6), int64(5) memory usage: 6.0 KB  In their paper, AJR note that their IV strategy will be invalidated if other factors are also highly persistent and related to the development of institutions within a country and to the country’s GDP.

It does variable selection and estimation simultaneously. It is a non-parametric (series) estimation technique part of a general class of estimators called penalized estimators. It allows the number of regressors, $p$, to be larger than the sample size, $n$.\nConsider data $D = \\lbrace x_i, y_i \\rbrace_{i=1}^n$ with $\\dim (x_i) = p$. Assume that $p$ is large relative to $n$. Two possible reasons:\n we have an intrinsic problem of high dimensionality $p$ indicates the number of expansion terms of small number of underlying important variables (e.g. series estimation)  Assumption: $y_i = x_i' \\beta_0 + r_i + \\varepsilon_i$ where $\\beta_0$ depends on $p$, $r_i$ is a remainder term.\nNote that in classic non-parametrics, we have $x_i'\\beta_0$ as $p_1(x_i) \\beta_{1,K} + \\dots + p_K(x_i) \\beta_{K,K}$. For simplicity, we assume $r_i = 0$, as if we had extreme undersmoothing. Hence the model becomes: $$ y_i = x_i' \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i, \\qquad p \\geq n $$ We cannot run OLS because $p \\geq n$, thus the rank condition is violated.\nDefinition We define the Lasso estimator as $$ \\hat{\\beta}_L = \\arg \\min \\quad \\underbrace{\\mathbb E_n \\Big[ (y_i - x_i' \\beta)^2 \\Big]} _ {\\text{SSR term}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\lambda}{n} \\sum _ {j=1}^{P} | \\beta_j |} _ {\\text{Penalty term}} $$ where $\\lambda$ is called penalty parameter.\nThe penalty term discourages large values of $| \\beta_j |$. The choice of $\\lambda$ is analogous to the choice of $K$ in series estimation and $h$ in kernel estimation.\nPenalties The shrinkage to zero of the coefficients directly follows from the $|| \\cdot ||_1$ norm. On the contrary, another famous penalized estimator, ridge regression, uses the $|| \\cdot ||_2$ norm and does not have this property.\n Minimizing SSR + penalty is equivalent to minimize SSR $s.t.$ pen $\\leq c$ (clear from the picture).\n Sparsity Let $S_0 = \\lbrace j: \\beta_{0,j} \\ne 0 \\rbrace$, we define $s_0 = |S_0|$ as the sparsity of $\\beta_0$. If $s_0/n \\to 0$, we are dealing with a sparse regression (analogous of smooth regression).\n Remark on sparsity:\n In words, sparsity means that even if we have a lot of variables, only a small number of them (relative to $n$) have an effect on the dependent variable. Approximate sparsity imposes a restriction that only $s_0$ variables among all of $x_{ij}$, where $s_0$ is much smaller than $n$, have associated coefficients $\\beta_{0j}$ that are different from zero, while permitting a nonzero approximation error. Thus, estimators for this kind of model attempt to learn the identities of the variables with large nonzero coefficients, while simultaneously estimating these coefficients. (Belloni et al., 2004) Sparsity is an assumption. $\\beta_0$ is said to be $s_0$-sparse with $s_0 \u0026lt; n$ if $$ | \\lbrace j: \\beta_{0j} \\neq 0 \\rbrace | \\leq s_0 $$   Lasso Theorem Theorem\nSuppose that for data $D_n = (y_i, x_i){i=1}^N$ with $y_i = x_i' \\beta + \\varepsilon_i$. Let $\\hat{\\beta}L$ be the Lasso estimator. Let $\\mathcal{S} = 2 \\max_j | \\mathbb E[ x{ij} \\varepsilon_i] |$. Suppose $|support(\\beta_0) \\leq s_0$ (sparsity assumption). Let $c_0 = (\\mathcal{S} + \\lambda/n )/(-\\mathcal{S} + \\lambda/n )$. Let $$ \\kappa{c_0, s_0} = \\min_{ d \\in \\mathbb R^p, A \\subseteq \\lbrace 1, \u0026hellip; , p \\rbrace : |A| \\leq s_0 , || d_{A^c}|| \\leq c_0 || d_A ||_1 } \\sqrt{ \\frac{ s_0 d' \\mathbb E_n [x_i x_i'] d }{|| d_A ||_1^2} } $$ Then\n$$ \\mathbb I_{ \\left\\lbrace \\frac{\\lambda}{n} \u0026gt; \\mathcal{S} \\right\\rbrace} \\mathbb E_n [(x_i \\beta_0 - x_i \\beta_L)^2]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\leq 2 \\frac{\\lambda}{n} \\frac{\\sqrt{s_0}}{\\kappa_{c_0, s_0}} $$\nIntuition: for a sufficiently high lambda the root mean squared error of Lasso is approximately zero.\n$$ \\text{ RMSE }: \\mathbb E_n [(x_i \\beta_0 - x_i \\beta_L)^2]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\simeq 0 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{\\lambda}{n} \u0026gt; \\mathcal{S} $$\nRemarks  The minimization region is the set of “essentially sparse” vectors $d \\in \\mathbb R^p$, where “essentially sparse” is defined by $\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{S}$. In particular the condition $k_{\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{S}}\u0026gt;0$ means that no essentially sparse vector $d$ has $\\mathbb E[x_i x_i']d = 0$, i.e. regressors were not added multiple times. Need to dominate the score with the penalty term $\\lambda$. Need no collinearity on a small ($\\leq s_0$) subset of regressors ($\\to k_{c_0, s_0}\u0026gt;0$).  When Lasso? For prediction problems in high dimensional environments. NB! Lasso is not good for inference, only for prediction.\nIn particular, in econometrics it’s used for selecting either\n instruments (predicting $\\hat{x}$ in the first stage) control variables (next section: double prediction problem, in the first stage and in the reduced form)  Choosing the Optimal Lambda The choice of $\\lambda$ determines the bias-variance tradeoff:\n if $\\lambda$ is too big: $\\lambda \\approx \\infty \\mathbb \\Rightarrow \\hat{\\beta} \\approx 0$; if $\\lambda$ is too small: $\\lambda \\approx 0 \\mathbb \\Rightarrow$ overfitting.  Possible solutions: Bonferroni correction, bootstrapping or $\\frac{\\lambda}{n} \\asymp \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log(p)}{n}}$ (asymptotically equal to), $\\mathcal{S}$ behaves like the maximum of gaussians.\nLasso Path How the estimated $\\hat{\\beta}$ depends on the penalty parameter $\\lambda$?\nPost Lasso: fit OLS without the penalty with all the nonzero coeficients selected by Lasso in the first step.\nRemarks  Do not do inference with post-Lasso because standard errors are not uniformely valid. As $n \\to \\infty$ the CV and the score domination bounds converge to a unique bound. What is the problem of cross-validation? In high dimensional settings you can overfit in so many ways that CV doesn’t work and still overfits. Using $\\lambda$ with $\\frac{\\lambda}{n} \u0026gt; \\mathcal{S}$ small coefficients get shrunk to zero with high probability. In this case with small we mean $\\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ or $2 \\max_j | \\mathbb E_n[\\varepsilon_i x_{ij}] |$. If $| \\beta_{0j}| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$ for a sufficiently small constant $c$, then $\\hat{\\beta}_{LASSO} \\overset{p}{\\to} 0$. In standard t-tests $c = 1.96$. $\\sqrt{n}$ factor is important since it is the demarcation line for reliable statistical detection.  Optimal Lambda What is the criterium that should guide the selection of $\\lambda$? $$ \\frac{\\lambda}{n} \\geq 2 \\mathbb E_n[x_{ij} \\varepsilon_i] \\qquad \\forall j \\quad \\text{ if } Var(x_{ij} \\varepsilon_i) = 1 $$\nHow to choose the optimal $\\lambda$:\n Decide the coverage of the confidence intervals ($1-\\alpha$): $$ \\Pr \\left( \\sqrt{n} \\Big| \\mathbb E_n [x_{ij} \\varepsilon_i] \\Big| \u0026gt; t \\right) = 1- \\alpha $$ Solve for $t$ Get $\\lambda$ such that all scores are dominated by $\\frac{\\lambda}{n}$ with $\\alpha%$ probability.   It turns out that the optimal $t \\propto \\sqrt{\\log(p)}$\n Pre-Testing Omitted Variable Bias Consider two separate statistical models. Assume the following long regression of interest:\n$$ y_i = x_i' \\alpha_0+ z_i' \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i $$\nDefine the corresponding short regression as\n$$ y_i = x_i' \\alpha_0 + v_i \\quad \\text{ with } v_i = z_i' \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i $$\nTheorem\nSuppose that the DGP for the long regression corresponds to $\\alpha_0$, $\\beta_0$. Suppose further that $\\mathbb E[x_i] = 0$, $\\mathbb E[z_i] = 0$, $\\mathbb E[\\varepsilon_i |x_i,z_i] = 0$. Then, unless $\\beta_0 = 0$ or $z_i$ is orthogonal to $x_i$, the (sole) stochastic regressor $x_i$ is correlated with the error term in the short regression which implies that the OLS estimator of the short regression is inconsistent for $\\alpha_0$ due to the omitted variable bias. In particular, one can show that the plim of the OLS estimator of $\\hat{\\alpha}{SHORT}$ from the short regression is $$ \\hat{\\alpha}{SHORT} \\overset{p}{\\to} \\frac{Cov(y_i, x_i)}{Var(x_i)} = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_0 \\frac{Cov(z_i, x_i)}{Var(x_i)} $$\nPre-test bias Consider data $D= (y_i, x_i, z_i)_{i=1}^n$, where the true model is: $$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; y_i = x_i' \\alpha_0 + z_i' \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i \\newline \u0026amp; x_i = z_i' \\gamma_0 + u_i \\end{aligned} $$\nWhere $x_i$ is the variable of interest (we want to make inference on $\\alpha_0$) and $z_i$ is a high dimensional set of control variables.\nFrom now on, we will work under the following assumptions:\n $\\dim(x_i)=1$ for all $n$ $\\beta_0$ uniformely bounded in $n$ Strict exogeneity: $\\mathbb E[\\varepsilon_i | x_i, z_i] = 0$ and $\\mathbb E[u_i | z_i] = 0$ $\\beta_0$ and $\\gamma_0$ have dimension (and hence value) that depend on $n$  Pre-Testing procedure  Regress $y_i$ on $x_i$ and $z_i$ For each $j = 1, \u0026hellip;, p = \\dim(z_i)$ calculate a test statistic $t_j$ Let $\\hat{T} = \\lbrace j: |t_j| \u0026gt; C \u0026gt; 0 \\rbrace$ for some constant $C$ (set of statistically significant coefficients). Re-run the new “model” using $(x_i, z_{\\hat{T},i})$ (i.e. using the selected covariates with statistically significant coefficients). Perform statistical inference (i.e. confidence intervals and hypothesis tests) as if no model selection had been done.  Bias As we can see from the figure above (code below), running the short regression instead of the long one introduces Omitted Variable Bias (second column). Instead, the Pre-Testing estimator is consistent but not normally distributed (third column).\nIssue Pre-testing is problematic because the post-selection estimator is not asymptotically normal. Moreover, for particular data generating processes, it even fails to be consistent at the rate of $\\sqrt{n}$ (Belloni et al., 2014).\n Intuition: when performing pre-testing, we might have an Omitted Variable Bias problem when $\\beta_0\u0026gt;0$ but we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0 : \\beta_0 = 0$ because of lack of statistical power, i.e. $|\\beta_0|$ is small with respect to the sample size. In particular, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for $\\beta_0(n) = O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)$. However, note that the problem vanishes asymptotically, as the resulting estimator is consistent. In fact, if $\\beta_0(n) = O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)$, then $\\alpha_0 - \\hat \\alpha_{PRETEST} \\overset{p}{\\to} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\beta_0 \\gamma_0 = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right) = 0$. We now clarify what it means to have a coefficient depending on the sample size, $\\beta_0(n)$.\n Uniformity Concept of uniformity: the DGP varies with $n$. Instead of having a fixed “true” parameter $\\beta_0$, you have a sequence $\\beta_0(n)$. Having a cofficient that depends on the sample size $n$ is useful to preserve the concept of “small with respect to the sample size” in asymptotic theory.\nIn the context of Pre-Testing, all problems vanish asymptotically since we are able to always reject the null hypothesis $H_0 : \\beta_0 = 0$ when $\\beta_0 \\neq 0$. In the figure below, I plot simulation results for $\\hat \\alpha_{PRETESTING}$ for a fixed coefficient $\\beta_0$ (first row) and variable coefficient $\\beta_0(n)$ that depends on the sample size (second row), for different sample sizes (columns). We see that if $\\beta_0$ is independent from the sample size (first row), the distribution of $\\hat \\alpha_{PRETEST}$ is not normal in small samples and it displays the bimodality that characterizes pre-testing. However, it becomes normal in large samples. On the other hand, when $\\beta_0(n)$ depends on the sample size, and in particular $\\beta_0 = O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$ (second row), the distribution of $\\hat \\alpha_{PRETEST}$ stays bimodal even when the sample size increases.\n Note that the estimator is always consistent!\n Where is Pre-Testing a Problem? If we were to draw a map of where the gaussianity assumption of $\\beta_0(n)$ holds well and where it fails, it would look like the following figure.\nIntuition The intuition for the three different regions (from bottom to top) is the following.\n When $\\beta_0 = o \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$, $z_i$ is excluded with probability $p \\to 1$. But, given that $\\beta_0$ is small enough, failing to control for $z_i$ does not introduce large omitted variables bias (Belloni et al., 2014). If however the coefficient on the control is “moderately close to zero”, $\\beta_0 = O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$, the t-test set-up above cannot distinguish this coefficient from $0$, and the control $z_i$ is dropped with probability $p \\to 1$. However, in this case the omitted variable bias generated by excluding $z_i$ scaled by $\\sqrt{n}$ does not converge to zero. That is, the standard post-selection estimator is not asymptotically normal and even fails to be consistent at the rate of $\\sqrt{n}$ (Belloni et al., 2014). Lastly, when $\\beta_0$ is large enough, the null pre-testing hypothesis $H_0 : \\beta_0 = 0$ will be rejected sufficiently often so that the bias is negligible.  Post-Double Selection The post-double-selection estimator, $\\hat{\\alpha}_{PDS}$ solves this problem by doing variable selection via standard t-tests or Lasso-type selectors with the two “true model” equations (first stage and reduced form) that contain the information from the model and then estimating $\\alpha_0$ by regressing $y_i$ on $x_i$ and the union of the selected controls. By doing so, $z_i$ is omitted only if its coefficient in both equations is small which greatly limits the potential for omitted variables bias (Belloni et al., 2014).\n Intuition: by performing post-double selection, we ensure that both $\\beta_0 = O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$ and $\\gamma_0 = O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$ so that $\\sqrt{n} ( \\hat \\alpha _ {PRETEST} - \\alpha _ 0) \\overset{p}{\\to} \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{n} \\beta_0 \\gamma_0 = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{n} O \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right) = 0$ and the estimator is gaussian.\n Frisch-Waugh Theorem Theorem\nConsider the data $D = \\lbrace x_i, y_i, z_i \\rbrace_{i=1}^\\infty$ with DGP: $Y = X \\alpha + Z \\beta + \\varepsilon$. The following estimators of $\\alpha$ are numerically equivalent (if $[X, Z]$ has full rank):\n $\\hat{\\alpha}$ from regressing $Y$ on $X, Z$ $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ from regressing $Y$ on $\\tilde{X}$ $\\bar{\\alpha}$ from regressing $\\tilde{Y}$ on $\\tilde{X}$  where the operation of passing to $Y, X$ to $\\tilde{Y}, \\tilde{X}$ is called projection out $Z$, e.g.$\\tilde{X}$ are the residuals from regressing $X$ on $Z$.\nProof (1) We want to show that $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\tilde{\\alpha}$.\nClaim: $\\hat{\\alpha } = \\tilde{\\alpha} \\Leftrightarrow \\tilde{X}' \\left[ (X - \\tilde{X})\\hat{\\alpha} + Z \\hat{\\beta} +\\hat{\\varepsilon} \\right] = 0$.\nProof of the claim: if $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\tilde{\\alpha}$, we can write $Y$ as $$ Y = X \\hat{\\alpha} + Z \\hat{\\beta} + \\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\tilde{X} \\hat{\\alpha} + \\underbrace{(X - \\tilde{X}) \\hat{\\alpha } + Z \\hat{\\beta} + \\hat{\\varepsilon}}_\\text{residual of $Y$ on $\\tilde{X} $} = \\tilde{X} \\tilde{\\alpha} + \\nu_i $$\nTherefore, by the orthogonality property of the OLS residual, it must be that $\\tilde{X}'\\nu_i= 0$. $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\nProof (1) Having established the claim, we want to show that the normal equation $\\tilde{X}' \\left[ (X - \\tilde{X})\\hat{\\alpha} + Z \\hat{\\beta} +\\hat{\\varepsilon} \\right] = 0$ is satisfied. We follow 3 steps:\n  First we have that $\\tilde{X}' (X - \\tilde{X})\\hat{\\alpha} = 0$. This follows from the fact that $\\tilde{X}' = X' M_Z$ and hence: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\tilde{X}' (X - \\tilde{X}) \u0026amp; = X' M_Z (X - M_Z) = X' M_Z X - X' \\overbrace{M_Z M_Z}^{M_Z} X \\newline \u0026amp; = X\u0026rsquo;M_Z X - X' M_Z X = 0 \\end{aligned} $$\n  $\\tilde{X}' Z \\hat{\\beta} = 0$ since $\\tilde{X}$ is the residual from the regression of $X$ on $Z$, by normal equation it holds that $\\tilde{X}' Z = 0$.\n  $\\tilde{X}' \\hat{\\varepsilon} = 0$. This follows from (i) $M_Z ' M_{X, Z} = M_{X,Z}$ and (ii) $X' M_{X, Z} = 0$: $$ \\tilde{X}' \\hat{\\varepsilon} = (M_Z X)' (M_{X, Z} \\varepsilon) = X\u0026rsquo;M_Z' M_{X, Z} \\varepsilon = \\underbrace{X' M_{X, Z}}_0 \\varepsilon = 0. $$ $$\\tag*{$\\blacksquare$}$$\n  The coefficient $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is a partial regression coefficient identified from the variation in $X$ that is orthogonal to $Z$. This is often known as residual variation.\nPost Double Selection Setting Consider again data $D= (y_i, x_i, z_i)_{i=1}^n$, where the true model is: $$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026amp; y_i = x_i' \\alpha_0 + z_i' \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i \\newline \u0026amp; x_i = z_i' \\gamma_0 + u_i \\end{aligned} $$\nWe would like to guard against pretest bias if possible, in order to handle high dimensional models. A good pathway towards motivating procedures which guard against pretest bias is a discussion of classical partitioned regression.\nConsider a regression $y_i$ on $x_i$ and $z_i$. $x_i$ is the 1-dimensional variable of interest, $z_i$ is a high-dimensional set of control variables. We have the following procedure:\n First Stage selection: lasso $x_i$ on $z_i$. Let the selected variables be collected in the set $S_{FS} \\subseteq z_i$ Reduced Form selection: lasso $y_i$ on $z_i$. Let the selected variables be collected in the set $S_{RF} \\subseteq z_i$ Regress $y_i$ on $x_i$ and $S_{FS} \\cup S_{RF}$  PDS Theorem Theorem\nLet $\\lbrace P^n\\rbrace$ be a sequence of data-generating processes for $D_n = (y_i, x_i, z_i)^n_{i=1} \\in (\\mathbb R \\times \\mathbb R \\times \\mathbb R^p) ^n$ where $p$ depends on $n$. For each $n$, the data are iid with $yi = x_i'\\alpha_0^{(n)} + z_i' \\beta_0^{(n)} + \\varepsilon_i$ and $x_i = z_i' \\gamma_0^{(n)} + u_i$ where $\\mathbb E[\\varepsilon_i | x_i,z_i] = 0$ and $\\mathbb E[u_i|z_i] = 0$. The sparsity of the vectors $\\beta_0^{(n)}$, $\\gamma_0^{(n)}$ is controlled by $|| \\beta_0^{(n)} ||_0 \\leq s$ with $s^2 (\\log p)^2/n \\to 0$. Suppose that additional regularity conditions on the model selection procedures and moments of the random variables $y_i$ , $x_i$ , $z_i$ as documented in Belloni et al. (2014). Then the confidence intervals, CI, from the post double selection procedure are uniformly valid. That is, for any confidence level $\\xi \\in (0, 1)$ $$ \\Pr(\\alpha_0 \\in CI) \\to 1- \\xi $$\nIn order to have valid confidence intervals you want their bias to be negligibly. Since $$ CI = \\left[ \\hat{\\alpha} \\pm \\frac{1.96 \\cdot \\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right] $$\nIf the bias is $o \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$ then there is no problem since it is asymptotically negligible w.r.t. the magnitude of the confidence interval. If however the the bias is $O \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$ then it has the same magnitude of the confidence interval and it does not asymptotically vanish.\nProof (Idea) The idea of the proof is to use partitioned regression. An alternative way to think about the argument is: bound the omitted variables bias. Omitted variable bias comes from the product of 2 quantities related to the omitted variable:\n Its partial correlation with the outcome, and Its partial correlation with the variable of interest.  If both those partial correlations are $O( \\sqrt{\\log p/n})$, then the omitted variables bias is $(s \\times O( \\sqrt{\\log p/n})^2 = o \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$, provided $s^2 (\\log p)^2/n \\to 0$. Relative to the $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ convergence rate, the omitted variables bias is negligible.\nIn our omitted variable bias case, we want $| \\beta_0 \\gamma_0 | = o \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$. Post-double selection guarantees that\n Reduced form selection (pre-testing): any “missing” variable has $|\\beta_{0j}| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$ First stage selection (additional): any “missing” variable has $|\\gamma_{0j}| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$  As a consequence, as long as the number of omitted variables is finite, the omitted variable bias is $$ OVB(\\alpha) = |\\beta_{0j}| \\cdot|\\gamma_{0j}| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}} \\cdot \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{c^2}{n} = o \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) $$\nDistribution We can plot the distribution of the post-double selection estimator against the pre-testing one.\n Remark: under homoskedasticity, the above estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound.\n ","date":1635465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635465600,"objectID":"836b9d8d9e375e7fccbc006323494047","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/course/metrics/09_selection/","publishdate":"2021-10-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/course/metrics/09_selection/","section":"course","summary":"Lasso Issue Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a popular method for high dimensional regression.

Rather, the goal is to discover interesting properties about the measurements on ${ X_1, . . . , X_p }$.\nQuestions that we are usually interested in are\n Clustering Dimensionality reduction  In general, unsupervised learning can be viewed as an extention of exploratory data analysis.\nDimensionality Reduction Working in high-dimensional spaces can be undesirable for many reasons; raw data are often sparse as a consequence of the curse of dimensionality, and analyzing the data is usually computationally intractable (hard to control or deal with).\nDimensionality reduction can also be useful to plot high-dimensional data.\nClustering Clustering refers to a very broad set of techniques for finding subgroups, or clusters, in a data set. When we cluster the observations of a data set, we seek to partition them into distinct groups so that the observations within each group are quite similar to each other, while observations in different groups are quite different from each other.\nIn this section we focus on the following algorithms:\n K-means clustering Hierarchical clustering Gaussian Mixture Models  Principal Component Analysis Suppose that we wish to visualize $n$ observations with measurements on a set of $p$ features, ${X_1, . . . , X_p}$, as part of an exploratory data analysis.\nWe could do this by examining two-dimensional scatterplots of the data, each of which contains the n observations’ measurements on two of the features. However, there are $p(p−1)/2$ such scatterplots; for example, with $p = 10$ there are $45$ plots!\nPCA provides a tool to do just this. It finds a low-dimensional represen- tation of a data set that contains as much as possible of the variation.\nFirst Principal Component The first principal component of a set of features ${X_1, . . . , X_p}$ is the normalized linear combination of the features $Z_1$\n$$ Z_1 = \\phi_{11} X_1 + \\phi_{21} X_2 + \u0026hellip; + \\phi_{p1} X_p $$\nthat has the largest variance.\nBy normalized, we mean that $\\sum_{i=1}^p \\phi^2_{i1} = 1$.\nPCA Computation In other words, the first principal component loading vector solves the optimization problem\n$$ \\underset{\\phi_{11}, \\ldots, \\phi_{p 1}}{\\max} \\ \\Bigg \\lbrace \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^{n}\\left(\\sum _ {j=1}^{p} \\phi _ {j1} x _ {ij} \\right)^{2} \\Bigg \\rbrace \\quad \\text { subject to } \\quad \\sum _ {j=1}^{p} \\phi _ {j1}^{2}=1 $$\nThe objective that we are maximizing is just the sample variance of the $n$ values of $z_{i1}$.\nAfter the first principal component $Z_1$ of the features has been determined, we can find the second principal component $Z_2$. The second principal component is the linear combination of ${X_1, . . . , X_p}$ that has maximal variance out of all linear combinations that are uncorrelated with $Z_1$.\nExample We illustrate the use of PCA on the USArrests data set.\nFor each of the 50 states in the United States, the data set contains the number of arrests per $100,000$ residents for each of three crimes: Assault, Murder, and Rape. We also record the percent of the population in each state living in urban areas, UrbanPop.\n# Load crime data df = pd.read_csv('data/USArrests.csv', index_col=0) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape   State         Alabama 13.2 236 58 21.2   Alaska 10.0 263 48 44.5   Arizona 8.1 294 80 31.0   Arkansas 8.8 190 50 19.5   California 9.0 276 91 40.6     Data Scaling To make all the features comparable, we first need to scale them.

Indeed what we performed above is a decomposition of the variance of $X$ into orthogonal components.\nThe constrained maximization problem above can be re-written in matrix notation as\n$$ \\max \\ \\phi' X\u0026rsquo;X \\phi \\quad \\text{ s. t. } \\quad \\phi'\\phi = 1 $$\nWhich has the following dual representation\n$$ \\mathcal L (\\phi, \\lambda) = \\phi' X\u0026rsquo;X \\phi - \\lambda (\\phi'\\phi - 1) $$\nIf we take the first order conditions\n$$ \\begin{align} \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\phi'\\phi - 1 \\ \u0026amp; \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal L}{\\partial \\phi} = 2 X\u0026rsquo;X \\phi - 2 \\lambda \\phi \\end{align} $$\nSetting the derivatives to zero at the optimum, we get\n$$ \\begin{align} \u0026amp; \\phi'\\phi = 1 \\ \u0026amp; X\u0026rsquo;X \\phi = \\lambda \\phi \\end{align} $$\nThus, $\\phi$ is an eigenvector of the covariance matrix $X\u0026rsquo;X$, and the maximizing vector will be the one associated with the largest eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\nEigenvalues and eigenvectors We can now double-check it using numpy linear algebra package.\neigenval, eigenvec = np.linalg.eig(X_scaled.T @ X_scaled) data = np.concatenate((eigenvec,eigenval.reshape(1,-1))) idx = list(df.columns) + ['Eigenvalue'] df_eigen = pd.DataFrame(data, index=idx, columns=['PC1', 'PC2','PC3','PC4']) df_eigen   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4     Murder 0.535899 0.418181 0.649228 -0.341233   Assault 0.583184 0.187986 -0.743407 -0.268148   UrbanPop 0.278191 -0.872806 0.133878 -0.378016   Rape 0.543432 -0.167319 0.089024 0.817778   Eigenvalue 124.012079 49.488258 8.671504 17.828159     The spectral decomposition of the variance of $X$ generates a set of orthogonal vectors (eigenvectors) with different magnitudes (eigenvalues). The eigenvalues tell us the amount of variance of the data in that direction.\nIf we combine the eigenvectors together, we form a projection matrix $P$ that we can use to transform the original variables: $\\tilde X = P X$\nX_transformed = X_scaled @ eigenvec df_transformed = pd.DataFrame(X_transformed, index=df.index, columns=['PC1', 'PC2','PC3','PC4']) df_transformed.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4   State         Alabama 0.985566 1.133392 0.156267 -0.444269   Alaska 1.950138 1.073213 -0.438583 2.040003   Arizona 1.763164 -0.745957 -0.834653 0.054781   Arkansas -0.141420 1.119797 -0.182811 0.114574   California 2.523980 -1.542934 -0.341996 0.598557     This is exactly the dataset that we obtained before.\nScaling the Variables The results obtained when we perform PCA will also depend on whether the variables have been individually scaled. In fact, the variance of a variable depends on its magnitude.\n# Variables variance df.var(axis=0)  Murder 18.970465 Assault 6945.165714 UrbanPop 209.518776 Rape 87.729159 dtype: float64  Consequently, if we perform PCA on the unscaled variables, then the first principal component loading vector will have a very large loading for Assault, since that variable has by far the highest variance.\n# Fit PCA with unscaled varaibles X = df.values pca2_u = PCA(n_components=2).fit(X)  # Get weights weights_u = pca2_u.components_.T df_weights_u = pd.DataFrame(weights_u, index=df.columns, columns=['PC1', 'PC2']) df_weights_u   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  PC1 PC2     Murder 0.041704 0.044822   Assault 0.995221 0.058760   UrbanPop 0.046336 -0.976857   Rape 0.075156 -0.200718     # Transform X to get the principal components X_dim2_u = pca2_u.transform(X) df_dim2_u = pd.DataFrame(X_dim2_u, columns=['PC1', 'PC2'], index=df.index)  Plotting We can compare the lower dimensional representations with and without scaling.\nmake_figure_10_1b(df_dim2, df_dim2_u, df_weights, df_weights_u)  As predicted, the first principal component loading vector places almost all of its weight on Assault, while the second principal component loading vector places almost all of its weight on UrpanPop. Comparing this to the left-hand plot, we see that scaling does indeed have a substantial effect on the results obtained. However, this result is simply a consequence of the scales on which the variables were measured.\nThe Proportion of Variance Explained We can now ask a natural question: how much of the information in a given data set is lost by projecting the observations onto the first few principal components? That is, how much of the variance in the data is not contained in the first few principal components? More generally, we are interested in knowing the proportion of variance explained (PVE) by each principal component.\n# Four components pca4 = PCA(n_components=4).fit(X_scaled)  # Variance of the four principal components pca4.explained_variance_  array([2.53085875, 1.00996444, 0.36383998, 0.17696948])  Interpretation We can compute it in percentage of the total variance.\n# As a percentage of the total variance pca4.explained_variance_ratio_  array([0.62006039, 0.24744129, 0.0891408 , 0.04335752])  In the Arrest dataset, the first principal component explains $62.0%$ of the variance in the data, and the next principal component explains $24.7%$ of the variance. Together, the first two principal components explain almost $87%$ of the variance in the data, and the last two principal components explain only $13%$ of the variance.\nPlotting We can plot in a graph the percentage of the variance explained, relative to the number of components.\nmake_figure_10_2(pca4)  How Many Principal Components? In general, a $n \\times p$ data matrix $X$ has $\\min{n − 1, p}$ distinct principal components. However, we usually are not interested in all of them; rather, we would like to use just the first few principal components in order to visualize or interpret the data.\nWe typically decide on the number of principal components required to visualize the data by examining a scree plot.\nHowever, there is no well-accepted objective way to decide how many principal com- ponents are enough.\nK-Means Clustering The idea behind K-means clustering is that a good clustering is one for which the within-cluster variation is as small as possible. Hence we want to solve the problem\n$$ \\underset{C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{K}}{\\operatorname{minimize}} \\Bigg\\lbrace \\sum_{k=1}^{K} W\\left(C_{k}\\right) \\Bigg\\rbrace $$\nwhere $C_k$ is a cluster and $ W(C_k)$ is a measure of the amount by which the observations within a cluster differ from each other.\nThere are many possible ways to define this concept, but by far the most common choice involves squared Euclidean distance. That is, we define\n$$ W\\left(C_{k}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\left|C_{k}\\right|} \\sum_{i, i^{\\prime} \\in C_{k}} \\sum_{j=1}^{p}\\left(x_{i j}-x_{i^{\\prime} j}\\right)^2 $$\nwhere $|C_k|$ denotes the number of observations in the $k^{th}$ cluster.\nAlgorithm   Randomly assign a number, from $1$ to $K$, to each of the observations. These serve as initial cluster assignments for the observations.\n  Iterate until the cluster assignments stop changing:\na) For each of the $K$ clusters, compute the cluster centroid. The kth cluster centroid is the vector of the $p$ feature means for the observations in the $k^{th}$ cluster.\nb) Assign each observation to the cluster whose centroid is closest (where closest is defined using Euclidean distance).\n  Generate the data We first generate a 2-dimensional dataset.\n# Simulate data np.random.seed(123) X = np.random.randn(50,2) X[0:25, 0] = X[0:25, 0] + 3 X[0:25, 1] = X[0:25, 1] - 4  make_new_figure_1(X)  Step 1: random assignement Now let\u0026rsquo;s randomly assign the data to two clusters, at random.\n# Init clusters K = 2 clusters0 = np.random.randint(K,size=(np.size(X,0)))  make_new_figure_2(X, clusters0)  Step 2: estimate distributions What are the new centroids?\n# Compute new centroids def compute_new_centroids(X, clusters): K = len(np.unique(clusters)) centroids = np.zeros((K,np.size(X,1))) for k in range(K): if sum(clusters==k)\u0026gt;0: centroids[k,:] = np.mean(X[clusters==k,:], axis=0) else: centroids[k,:] = np.mean(X, axis=0) return centroids  # Print centroids0 = compute_new_centroids(X, clusters0) print(centroids0)  [[ 1.54179703 -1.65922379] [ 1.67917325 -2.36272948]]  Plotting the centroids Let\u0026rsquo;s add the centroids to the graph.\n# Plot plot_assignment(X, centroids0, clusters0, 0, 0)  Step 3: assign data to clusters Now we can assign the data to the clusters, according to the closest centroid.\n# Assign X to clusters def assign_to_cluster(X, centroids): K = np.size(centroids,0) dist = np.zeros((np.size(X,0),K)) for k in range(K): dist[:,k] = np.mean((X - centroids[k,:])**2, axis=1) clusters = np.argmin(dist, axis=1) # Compute inertia inertia = 0 for k in range(K): if sum(clusters==k)\u0026gt;0: inertia += np.sum((X[clusters==k,:] - centroids[k,:])**2) return clusters, inertia  Plotting assigned data # Get cluster assignment [clusters1,d] = assign_to_cluster(X, centroids0)  # Plot plot_assignment(X, centroids0, clusters1, d, 1)  Full Algorithm We now have all the components to proceed iteratively.\ndef kmeans_manual(X, K): # Init i = 0 d0 = 1e4 d1 = 1e5 clusters = np.random.randint(K,size=(np.size(X,0))) # Iterate until convergence while np.abs(d0-d1) \u0026gt; 1e-10: d1 = d0 centroids = compute_new_centroids(X, clusters) [clusters, d0] = assign_to_cluster(X, centroids) plot_assignment(X, centroids, clusters, d0, i) i+=1  Plotting k-means clustering # Test kmeans_manual(X, K)  Here the observations can be easily plotted because they are two-dimensional. If there were more than two variables then we could instead perform PCA and plot the first two principal components score vectors.\nMore clusters In the previous example, we knew that there really were two clusters because we generated the data. However, for real data, in general we do not know the true number of clusters. We could instead have performed K-means clustering on this example with K = 3. If we do this, K-means clustering will split up the two \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; clusters, since it has no information about them:\n# K=3 kmeans_manual(X, 3)  Sklearn package The automated function in sklearn to persorm $K$-means clustering is KMeans.\n# SKlearn algorithm km1 = KMeans(n_clusters=3, n_init=1, random_state=1) km1.fit(X)  KMeans(n_clusters=3, n_init=1, random_state=1)  Plotting We can plot the asssignment generated by the KMeans function.\n# Plot plot_assignment(X, km1.cluster_centers_, km1.labels_, km1.inertia_, km1.n_iter_)  As we can see, the results are different in the two algorithms? Why? $K$-means is susceptible to the initial values. One way to solve this problem is to run the algorithm multiple times and report only the best results\nInitial Assignment To run the Kmeans() function in python with multiple initial cluster assignments, we use the n_init argument (default: 10). If a value of n_init greater than one is used, then K-means clustering will be performed using multiple random assignments, and the Kmeans() function will report only the best results.\n# 30 runs km_30run = KMeans(n_clusters=3, n_init=30, random_state=1).fit(X) plot_assignment(X, km_30run.cluster_centers_, km_30run.labels_, km_30run.inertia_, km_30run.n_iter_)  Best Practices It is generally recommended to always run K-means clustering with a large value of n_init, such as 20 or 50 to avoid getting stuck in an undesirable local optimum.\nWhen performing K-means clustering, in addition to using multiple initial cluster assignments, it is also important to set a random seed using the random_state parameter. This way, the initial cluster assignments can be replicated, and the K-means output will be fully reproducible.\nHierarchical Clustering One potential disadvantage of K-means clustering is that it requires us to pre-specify the number of clusters $K$.\nHierarchical clustering is an alternative approach which does not require that we commit to a particular choice of $K$.\nThe Dendogram Hierarchical clustering has an added advantage over K-means clustering in that it results in an attractive tree-based representation of the observations, called a dendrogram.\nd = dendrogram( linkage(X, \u0026quot;complete\u0026quot;), leaf_rotation=90., # rotates the x axis labels leaf_font_size=8., # font size for the x axis labels )  Interpretation Each leaf of the dendrogram represents one observation.\nAs we move up the tree, some leaves begin to fuse into branches. These correspond to observations that are similar to each other. As we move higher up the tree, branches themselves fuse, either with leaves or other branches. The earlier (lower in the tree) fusions occur, the more similar the groups of observations are to each other.\nWe can use de dendogram to understand how similar two observations are: we can look for the point in the tree where branches containing those two obse rvations are first fused. The height of this fusion, as measured on the vertical axis, indicates how different the two observations are. Thus, observations that fuse at the very bottom of the tree are quite similar to each other, whereas observations that fuse close to the top of the tree will tend to be quite different.\nThe term hierarchical refers to the fact that clusters obtained by cutting the dendrogram at a given height are necessarily nested within the clusters obtained by cutting the dendrogram at any greater height.\nThe Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm   Begin with $n$ observations and a measure (such as Euclidean distance) of all the $n(n − 1)/2$ pairwise dissimilarities. Treat each 2 observation as its own cluster.\n  For $i=n,n−1,\u0026hellip;,2$\na) Examine all pairwise inter-cluster dissimilarities among the $i$ clusters and identify the pair of clusters that are least dissimilar (that is, most similar). Fuse these two clusters. The dissimilarity between these two clusters indicates the height in the dendrogram at which the fusion should be placed.\nb) Compute the new pairwise inter-cluster dissimilarities among the $i−1$ remaining clusters.\n  The Linkage Function We have a concept of the dissimilarity between pairs of observations, but how do we define the dissimilarity between two clusters if one or both of the clusters contains multiple observations?\nThe concept of dissimilarity between a pair of observations needs to be extended to a pair of groups of observations. This extension is achieved by developing the notion of linkage, which defines the dissimilarity between two groups of observations.\nLinkages The four most common types of linkage are:\n Complete: Maximal intercluster dissimilarity. Compute all pairwise dissimilarities between the observations in cluster A and the observations in cluster B, and record the largest of these dissimilarities. Single: Minimal intercluster dissimilarity. Compute all pairwise dissimilarities between the observations in cluster A and the observations in cluster B, and record the smallest of these dissimilarities. Average: Mean intercluster dissimilarity. Compute all pairwise dissimilarities between the observations in cluster A and the observations in cluster B, and record the average of these dissimilarities. Centroid: Dissimilarity between the centroid for cluster A (a mean vector of length p) and the centroid for cluster B. Centroid linkage can result in undesirable inversions.  Average, complete, and single linkage are most popular among statisticians. Average and complete linkage are generally preferred over single linkage, as they tend to yield more balanced dendrograms. Centroid linkage is often used in genomics, but suffers from a major drawback in that an inversion can occur, whereby two clusters are fused at a height below either of the individual clusters in the dendrogram. This can lead to difficulties in visualization as well as in interpretation of the dendrogram.\n# Init linkages = [hierarchy.complete(X), hierarchy.average(X), hierarchy.single(X)] titles = ['Complete Linkage', 'Average Linkage', 'Single Linkage']  Plotting make_new_figure_4(linkages, titles)  For this data, both complete and average linkage generally separates the observations into their correct groups.\nGaussian Mixture Models Clustering methods such as hierarchical clustering and K-means are based on heuristics and rely primarily on finding clusters whose members are close to one another, as measured directly with the data (no probability model involved).\nGaussian Mixture Models assume that the data was generated by multiple multivariate gaussian distributions. The objective of the algorithm is to recover these latent distributions.\nThe advantages with respect to K-means are\n a structural interpretaion of the parameters automatically generates class probabilities can generate clusters of observations that are not necessarily close to each other  Algorithm   Randomly assign a number, from $1$ to $K$, to each of the observations. These serve as initial cluster assignments for the observations.\n  Iterate until the cluster assignments stop changing:\na) For each of the $K$ clusters, compute its mean and variance. The main difference with K-means is that we also compute the variance matrix.\nb) Assign each observation to its most likely cluster.\n  Dataset Let\u0026rsquo;s use the same data we have used for k-means, for a direct comparison.\nmake_new_figure_1(X)  Step 1: random assignement Let\u0026rsquo;s also use the same random assignment of the K-means algorithm.\nmake_new_figure_2(X, clusters0)  Step 2: compute distirbutions What are the new distributions?\n# Compute new centroids def compute_distributions(X, clusters): K = len(np.unique(clusters)) distr = [] for k in range(K): if sum(clusters==k)\u0026gt;0: distr += [multivariate_normal(np.mean(X[clusters==k,:], axis=0), np.cov(X[clusters==k,:].T))] else: distr += [multivariate_normal(np.mean(X, axis=0), np.cov(X.T))] return distr  # Print distr0 = compute_distributions(X, clusters0) print(\u0026quot;Mean of the first distribution: \\n\u0026quot;, distr0[0].mean) print(\u0026quot;\\nVariance of the first distribution: \\n\u0026quot;, distr0[0].cov)  Mean of the first distribution: [ 1.54179703 -1.65922379] Variance of the first distribution: [[ 3.7160256 -2.27290036] [-2.27290036 4.67223237]]  Plotting the distributions Let\u0026rsquo;s add the distributions to the graph.\n# Plot plot_assignment_gmm(X, clusters0, distr0, i=0, logL=0.0)  Likelihood The main difference with respect with K-means is that we can now compute the probability that each observation belongs to each cluster. This is the probability that each observation was generated by one of the two bi-variate normal distributions. These probabilities are called likelihoods.\n# Print first 5 likelihoods pdfs0 = np.stack([d.pdf(X) for d in distr0], axis=1) pdfs0[:5]  array([[0.03700522, 0.05086876], [0.00932081, 0.02117353], [0.04092453, 0.04480732], [0.00717854, 0.00835799], [0.01169199, 0.01847373]])  Step 3: assign data to clusters Now we can assign the data to the clusters, via maximum likelihood.\n# Assign X to clusters def assign_to_cluster_gmm(X, distr): pdfs = np.stack([d.pdf(X) for d in distr], axis=1) clusters = np.argmax(pdfs, axis=1) log_likelihood = 0 for k, pdf in enumerate(pdfs): log_likelihood += np.log(pdf[clusters[k]]) return clusters, log_likelihood  # Get cluster assignment clusters1, logL1 = assign_to_cluster_gmm(X, distr0)  Plotting assigned data # Compute new distributions distr1 = compute_distributions(X, clusters1)  # Plot plot_assignment_gmm(X, clusters1, distr1, 1, logL1);  Expectation - Maximization The two steps we have just seen, are part of a broader family of algorithms to maximize likelihoods called expectation-maximization algorithms.\nIn the expectation step, we computed the expectation of the parameters, given the current cluster assignment.\nIn the maximization step, we assigned observations to the cluster that maximized the likelihood of the single observation.\nThe alternative, and more computationally intensive procedure, would have been to specify a global likelihood function and find the mean and variance paramenters of the two normal distributions that maximized those likelihoods.\nFull Algorithm We can now deploy the full algorithm.\ndef gmm_manual(X, K): # Init i = 0 logL0 = 1e4 logL1 = 1e5 clusters = np.random.randint(K,size=(np.size(X,0))) # Iterate until convergence while np.abs(logL0-logL1) \u0026gt;

Randomly assigning the treatment (new product, feature, UI, \u0026hellip;) to a subset of the population (users, patients, customers, \u0026hellip;) we ensure that, on average, the difference in outcomes (revenue, visits, clicks, \u0026hellip;) can be attributed to the treatment. Many companies, especially in tech, before implementing any major change test them to back up their decisions with numbers. Established companies like Booking.com report constantly running thousands of AB tests at the same time. And newer growing companies like Duolingo attribute a large chunk of their success to their culture of experimentation at scale.\nWith so many experiments, one question comes natural: in one specific experiment, can you leverage information from previous tests? In this post, I will try to answer this question by introducing the Bayesian approach to AB testing. The Bayesian framework is particularly well suited for this type of task because it naturally allows for the updating of existing knowledge (the prior) using new data. However, the method is particularly sensitive to functional form assumptions and apparently innocuous model choices can translate in sensible differences in the estimates, especially when the data is very skewed.\nSearch and Infinite Scrolling For the rest of the article, we are going to use a toy example, loosely inspired by Azavedo et al. (2019): a search engine that wants to increase its ad revenue, without sacrificing search quality. We are a company with an established experimentation culture and we continuously test new ideas on how to rank results, how to select the most relevant ads for consumers, and the user interface (UI) of the results page. Suppose that, in this specific case, we came up with a new brilliant idea: infinite scrolling! Instead of having a discrete sequence of pages, we allow users to keep scrolling down if they want to see more results.\nTo understand whether infinite scrolling works, we ran an AB test: we randomize users into a treatment and a control group. We implement infinite scrolling only for users in the treatment group. I import the data generating process dgp_infinite_scroll() from src.dgp. With respect to previous articles, I generated a new DGP parent class that handles randomization and data generation, while its children classes contain the specific use-cases. I also import some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils. To include not only code but also data and tables, I use Deepnote, a Jupyter-like web-based collaborative notebook environment.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' from src.utils import * from src.dgp import DGP, dgp_infinite_scroll  dgp = dgp_infinite_scroll(n=10_000) df = dgp.generate_data(true_effect=0.14) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  past_revenue infinite_scroll ad_revenue     0 3.76 1 3.70   1 2.40 1 1.71   2 2.98 1 4.85   3 4.24 1 4.57   4 3.87 0 3.69     We have information on $10.000$ website visitors for which we observe the monthly ad_revenue they generated, whether they were assigned to the treatment group and were using the infinite_scroll, and also the average monthly past_revenue.\nThe random treatment assignment makes the difference-in-means estimator unbiased: we expect the treatment and control group to be comparable on average, so we can causal attribute the average observed difference in outcomes to the treatment effect. We estimate the treatment effect by linear regression. We can interpret the coefficient of infinite_scroll as the estimated treatment effect.\nsmf.ols('ad_revenue ~ infinite_scroll', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  1.9865  0.020  101.320  0.000  1.948  2.025   infinite_scroll  0.1524  0.028  5.461  0.000  0.098  0.207   It seems that the infinite_scroll was indeed a good idea and it increase the average monthly revenue by $0.1524$$. Moreover, the effect is significantly different from zero at the 1% confidence level.\nWe could further improve the precision of the estimator by controlling for past_revenue in the regression. We do not expect a sensible change in the estimated coefficient, but the precision should improve (if you want to know more on out control variables, check my other articles on CUPED and DAGs).\nreg = smf.ols('ad_revenue ~ infinite_scroll + past_revenue', df).fit() reg.summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  0.0181  0.024  0.741  0.459  -0.030  0.066   infinite_scroll  0.1571  0.020  7.910  0.000  0.118  0.196   past_revenue  0.9922  0.010  98.655  0.000  0.972  1.012   Indeed, past_revenue is highly predictive of current ad_revenue and the precision of the estimated coefficient for infinite_scroll decreases by one-third.\nSo far, everything has been very standard. However, as we said at the beginning, suppose this is not the only experiment we ran trying to improve our browser (and ultimately ad revenue). The infinite scroll is just one idea among thousands of others that we have tested in the past. Is there a way to efficiently use this additional information?\nBayesian Statistics One of the main advantages of Bayesian statistics over the frequentist approach is that it easily allows to incorporate additional information into a model. The idea directly follows from the main results behind all Bayesian statistics: Bayes Theorem. Bayes theorem, allows you to do inference on a model by inverting the inference problem: from the probability of the model given the data, to the probability of the data given the model, a much easier object to deal with.\n$$ \\underbrace{ \\Pr \\big( \\text{model} \\ \\big| \\ \\text{data} \\big) }{\\text{posterior}} = \\underbrace{ \\Pr(\\text{model}) }{\\text{prior}} \\ \\underbrace{ \\frac{ \\Pr \\big( \\text{data} \\ \\big| \\ \\text{model} \\big) }{ \\Pr(\\text{data}) } }_{\\text{likelihood}} $$\nWe can split the right-hand side of Bayes Theorem (or Rule) into two components: the prior and the likelihood. The likelihood is the information about the model that comes from the data, the prior instead is any additional information about the model.\nFirst of all, let\u0026rsquo;s map Bayes theorem into our context. What is the data, what is the model and what is our object of interest?\n the data which consists in our outcome variable ad_revenue, $y$, the treatment infinite_scroll, $D$ and the other variables, past_revenue and a constant, which we jointly denote as $X$ the model is the distribution of ad_revenue, given past_revenue and the infinite_scroll feature, $y | D, X$ our object of interest is the posterior $\\Pr \\big( \\text{model} \\ \\big| \\ \\text{data} \\big)$, in particular the relationship between ad_revenue and infinite_scroll  X = sm.add_constant(df[['past_revenue']].values) D = df['infinite_scroll'].values y = df['ad_revenue'].values  How do we use prior information in the context of AB testing, potentially including additional covariates?\nBayesian Regression Let\u0026rsquo;s use a linear model to make it directly comparable with the frequentist approach:\n$$ y_i = \\beta X_i + \\tau D_i + \\varepsilon_i \\qquad \\text{where} \\quad \\varepsilon_i \\sim N \\big( 0, \\sigma^2 \\big) $$\nThis is a parametric model with two sets of parameters: the linear coefficients $\\beta$ and $\\tau$, and the variance of the residuals $\\sigma$. An equivalent, but more Bayesian, way to write the model is:\n$$ y \\ | \\ X, D; \\beta, \\tau, \\sigma \\sim N \\Big( \\beta X + \\tau D \\ , \\sigma^2 \\Big) , $$\nwhere the semi-column separates the data from the model parameters. Differently from the frequentist approach, in Bayesian regressions we do not rely on the central limit theorem to approximate the conditional distribution of $y$, but we directly assume it is normal. Is it just a formality? Not really, but a proper comparison between the frequentist and Bayesian approach is beyond the scope of this article.\nWe are interested in doing inference on the model parameters, $\\beta$, $\\tau$, and $\\sigma$. Another core difference between the frequentist and the Bayesian approach is that the the first assumes that the model parameters are fixed (scalars), while the latter allows them to be stochastic (random variables).\nThis assumption has a very practical implication: you can easily incorporate previous information about the model parameters in the form of prior distributions. As the name says, priors contain information that was available even before looking at the data. This leads to one of the most relevant questions in Bayesian statistics: how do you chose a prior?\nPriors When choosing a prior, one analytically appealing restriction is to have a prior distribution such that the posterior belongs to the same family. These priors are called conjugate priors. For example, before seeing the data, I assume my treatment effect is normally distributed and I would like it to be normally distributed also after incorporating the information contained in the data.\nIn the case of Bayesian linear regression, the conjugate priors for $\\beta$ and $\\sigma$ are normally and inverse-gamma distributed. Let\u0026rsquo;s start a bit blindly, by taking a standard normal and inverse gamma distribution as prior.\n$$ \\beta_i \\sim N(\\boldsymbol 0, \\boldsymbol 1) \\ \\tau_i \\sim N(0,1) \\ \\sigma^2 \\sim \\Gamma^{-1} (1, 1) $$\nWe use the package PyMC to do inference. First we need to specify the model: what are the distributions of the different parameters (priors) and what is the likelihood of the data.\nimport pymc as pm with pm.Model() as baseline_model: # Priors beta = pm.MvNormal('beta', mu=np.ones(np.shape(X)[1]), cov=np.eye(np.shape(X)[1])) tau = pm.Normal('tau', mu=0, sigma=1) sigma = pm.InverseGamma('sigma', mu=1, sigma=1, initval=1) # Likelihood Ylikelihood = pm.Normal('y', mu=(X@beta + D@tau).flatten(), sigma=sigma, observed=y)  PyMC has an extremely nice function that allows us to visualize the model as a graph, model_to_graphviz.\npm.model_to_graphviz(baseline_model)  From the graphical representation, we can see the various model components, their distributions, and how they interact with each other.\nWe are now ready to compute the model posterior. How does it work? In short, we sample realizations of model parameters, we compute the likelihood of the data given those values and the compute the corresponding posterior.\nidata = pm.sample(model=baseline_model, draws=1000)  Auto-assigning NUTS sampler...

The fact that Bayesian inference requires sampling, has been historically one of the main bottlenecks of Bayesian statistics, since it makes it sensibly slower than the frequentist approach. However, this is less and less of a problem with the increased computational power of model computers.\nWe are now ready to print out results. First, with the summary() method, we can print a model summary very similar to those produced by the statsmodels package.\npm.summary(idata, hdi_prob=0.95).round(4)   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  mean sd hdi_2.5% hdi_97.5% mcse_mean mcse_sd ess_bulk ess_tail r_hat     beta[0] 0.019 0.025 -0.031 0.068 0.001 0.0 1943.0 1866.0 1.0   beta[1] 0.992 0.010 0.970 1.011 0.000 0.0 2239.0 1721.0 1.0   tau 0.157 0.021 0.117 0.197 0.000 0.0 2770.0 2248.0 1.0   sigma 0.993 0.007 0.980 1.007 0.000 0.0 3473.0 2525.0 1.0     The estimated parameters are extremely close to the ones we got with the frequentist approach, with an estimated effect of the infinite_scroll equal to $0.157$.\nIf sampling had the disadvantage of being slow, it has the advantage of being very transparent. We can directly plot the distribution of the posterior. Let\u0026rsquo;s do it for the treatment effect $\\tau$. The PyMC function plot_posterior plots the distribution of the posterior, with a black bar for the Bayesian equivalent of a 95% confidence interval.\npm.plot_posterior(idata, kind=\u0026quot;hist\u0026quot;, var_names=('tau'), hdi_prob=0.95, figsize=(6, 3), bins=30);  As expected, since we chose conjugate priors, the posterior distribution looks gaussian.\nSo far we have chosen the prior without much guidance. However, suppose we had access to past experiments. How do we incorporate this specific information?\nPast Experiments Suppose the idea of the infinite scroll, was just one among a ton of other ones that we tried and tested in the past. For each idea we have the data for the corresponding experiment, with the corresponding estimated coefficient. Suppose we had a thousand of them.\npast_experiments = [dgp.generate_data(seed_data=i) for i in range(1000)] taus = [smf.ols('ad_revenue ~ infinite_scroll + past_revenue', pe).fit().params.values for pe in past_experiments]  How do we use this additional information?\nNormal Prior The first idea could be to calibrate our prior to reflect the data distribution in the past.

Why is it the case?\nThe fact is that the previous coefficient of $0.12$ is extremely unlikey, given our prior. We can compute the probability of getting the same or a more extreme value, given the prior.\n1 - sp.stats.norm(taus_mean, taus_std).cdf(0.12)  2.025724712373389e-05  The probability of such value is almost zero. Therefore, the estimated coefficient has moved towards the prior mean of $0.0009$.\nStudent t Prior So far, we have assumed a normal distribution for all linear coefficients. Is it appropriate? Let\u0026rsquo;s check it visually (check here for other methods on how to compare distributions).\nsns.histplot([tau[0] for tau in taus]).set(title=r'Distribution of $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ in past experiments');  The distribution seems pretty normal.

While at the center it looks like a normal distributions, the tails are much \u0026ldquo;fatter\u0026rdquo; and we have a couple of very extreme values. excluding the case of measurement error, this is a setting that happens often in the industry, where most ideas have extremely small or null effects and very rarely an idea is actually a breakthrough.\nOne way to model this distribution is a student-t distribution. In particular, we use a t-student with mean $0.0009$, variance $0.003$ and $1.3$ degrees of freedom to match the moments of the empirical distributions of past estimates.\nwith pm.Model() as model_studentt_prior: # Priors k = np.shape(X)[1] beta = pm.MvNormal('beta', mu=np.ones(k), cov=np.eye(k)) tau = pm.StudentT('tau', mu=taus_mean, sigma=0.003, nu=1.3) sigma = pm.InverseGamma('sigma', mu=1, sigma=1, initval=1) # Likelihood Ylikelihood = pm.Normal('y', mu=(X@beta + D@tau).flatten(), sigma=sigma, observed=y)  Let\u0026rsquo;s sample from the model.\nidata_studentt_priors = pm.sample(model=model_studentt_prior, draws=1000)  Auto-assigning NUTS sampler...

However, the estimate is more precise since the confidence interval has shrunk from $[0.077, 0.016]$ to $[0.065, 0.015]$.\nWhat has happened?\nShrinking The answer lies in the shape of the different prior distributions that we have used:\n standard normal, $N(0,1)$ normal with matched moments, $N(0, 0.03)$ t-student with matched moments, $t_{1.3}$(0, 0.003)$  t_hats = np.linspace(-0.3, 0.3, 1_000) distributions = { 'N(0,1)': sp.stats.norm(0, 1).pdf(t_hats), 'N(0, 0.03)': sp.stats.norm(0, 0.03).pdf(t_hats), '$t_{1.3}$(0, 0.003)': sp.stats.t(df=1.3).pdf(t_hats / 0.003)*300, }  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot all of them together.\nfor i, (label, y) in enumerate(distributions.items()): sns.lineplot(x=t_hats, y=y, color=f'C{i}', label=label); plt.xlim(-0.15, 0.15); plt.legend(); plt.title('Prior Distributions');  As we can see, all distributions are centered on zero, but they have very different shapes. The standard normal distribution is essentially flat over the $[-0.15, 0.15]$ interval. Every value has basically the same probability. The last two instead, even though they have the same mean and variance, have very different shapes.\nHow does it translate into our estimation? We can plot the implied posterior for different estimates, for each prior distribution.\ndef compute_posterior(b, prior): likelihood = sp.stats.norm(b, taus_std).pdf(t_hats) return np.average(t_hats, weights=prior*likelihood)  fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,6)) ax.axvline(0, lw=1.5, c='k'); ax.axhline(0, lw=1.5, c='k'); ax.axvline(0.12, lw=2, ls='--', c='darkgray'); for i, (label, y) in enumerate(distributions.items()): sns.lineplot(x=t_hats, y=[compute_posterior(t, y) for t in t_hats] , color=f'C{i}', label=label); ax.set_xlim(-0.16, 0.16); ax.set_ylim(-0.16, 0.16); plt.legend(); ax.set_xlabel('Experiment Estimate'); ax.set_ylabel('Posterior');  As we can see, the different priors transform the experimental estimates in very different ways. The standard normal prior essentially has no effect for estimates in the $[-0.15, 0.15]$ interval. The normal prior with matched moments instead shrinks each estimate by approximately 2/3. The effect of the t-student prior is instead non-linear: it shrinks small estimates towards zero, while it keeps large estimates as they are.\nMy intuition is the following. A prior distribution very skewed or with \u0026ldquo;fat tails\u0026rdquo; means that large values are rare but not impossible. In practice, it means accepting that breakthrough improvements are possible. On the other hand, for the same variance, the distribution is more concentrated around zero than a standard normal so that small values are shrunk even more.\nConclusion In this article we have seen how to extend the analysis of AB test to incorporate information from past experiments. In particular, we have seen the importance of choosing a prior. Selecting the distribution function is just as important as tuning its parameters. The shape of the prior distribution can drastically affect our inference, especially in a world with skewed distributions.\nDespite the length of the article, this was just a glimpse in the world of AB testing and Bayesian statistics. While being computationally more intensive and requiring additional assumptions, the Bayesian approach is often more natural, powerful and flexible than the frequentist one. Knowing pros and cons of both approaches is crucial to get the best of both worlds, picking the approach that work best or combining them efficiently.\nReferences   E. Azevedo, A. Deng, J. Olea, G.

In other words, is the investment worth the cost? Common examples include investments in computing resources, returns on advertisement, but also click-through rates and other ratio metrics.\nWhen we investigate causal effects, the gold standard is randomized control trials, a.k.a. AB tests. Randomly assigning the treatment to a subset of the population (users, patients, customers, \u0026hellip;) we ensure that, on average, the difference in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment. However, when the object of interest is cost-effectiveness, AB tests present some additional problems since we are not just interested in one treatment effect, but in the ratio of two treatment effects, the outcome of the investment over its cost.\nIn this post we are going to see how to analyze randomized experiments when the object of interest is the return on investment (ROI). We are going to explore alternative metrics to measure whether an investment paid off. We will also introduce a very powerful tool for inference with complex metrics: the delta method. While the algebra can be intense, the result is simple: we can compute the confidence interval for our ratio estimator using a simple linear regression.\nInvesting in Cloud Computing To better illustrate the concepts, we are going to use a toy example throughout the article: suppose we were an online marketplace and we wanted to invest in cloud computing: we want to increase the computing power behind our internal search engine, by switching to a higher tier server. The idea is that the faster search will improve the user experience, potentially leading to higher sales. Therefore, the question is: is the investment worth the cost? The object of interest is the return on investment (ROI).\nDifferently from usual AB tests or randomized experiments, we are not interested in a single causal effect, but in the ratio of two metrics: the effect on revenue and the effect on cost. We will still use a randomized control trial or AB test to estimate the ROI: we randomly assign groups of users to either the treatment or the control group. The treated users will benefit from the faster cloud machines, while the control users will use the old slower machines. Randomization ensures that we can estimate the impact of the new machines on either cost or revenue by comparing users in the treatment and control group: the difference in their average is an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect. However, things are more complicated for their ratio.\nI import the data generating process dgp_cloud() from src.dgp. With respect to previous articles, I generated a new DGP parent class that handles randomization and data generation, while its children classes contain the specific use-cases. I also import some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils. To include not only code but also data and tables, I use Deepnote, a Jupyter-like web-based collaborative notebook environment.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_cloud, DGP  dgp = dgp_cloud(n=10_000) df = dgp.generate_data(seed_assignment=6) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  new_machine cost revenue     0 1 3.14 20.90   1 0 3.77 33.57   2 1 3.16 24.31   3 0 2.36 20.35   4 0 1.65 12.60     The data contains information on the total cost and revenue for a set of $10.000$ users over a period of a month. We also have information on the treatment: whether the search engine was running on the old or new machines. As it often happens with business metrics, both distributions of cost and revenues are very skewed. Moreover, most people do not buy anything and therefore generate zero revenue, even though they still use the platform, generating positive costs.\nfix, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 5)) sns.histplot(df.cost, ax=ax1, color='C0').set(title='Distribution of Cost') sns.histplot(df.revenue, ax=ax2, color='C1').set(title='Distribution of Revenue');  We can compute the difference-in-means estimate for cost and revenue by regressing the outcome on the treatment indicator.\nsmf.ols('cost ~ new_machine', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  2.9617  0.043  69.034  0.000  2.878  3.046   new_machine  0.5152  0.060  8.563  0.000  0.397  0.633   The average cost has increased by $0.5152$$ per user.

So, was the investment profitable?\nTo answer this question, we first have to decide which metric to use as our outcome metric. In case of ratio metrics, this is not trivial.\nAverage Return or Return of the Average? It is very tempting to approach this problem saying: it is true that we have two variables, by we can just compute their ratio, and then analyze everything as usual, using a single variable: the individual level return.\n$$ \\rho_i = \\frac{\\text{individual revenue}}{\\text{individual cost}} = \\frac{R_i}{C_i} $$\nWhat happens if we analyze the experiment using this single metric?\ndf[\u0026quot;rho\u0026quot;] = df[\u0026quot;revenue\u0026quot;] / df[\u0026quot;cost\u0026quot;] smf.ols(\u0026quot;rho ~ new_machine\u0026quot;, df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  6.6898  0.044  150.832  0.000  6.603  6.777   new_machine  -0.7392  0.062  -11.893  0.000  -0.861  -0.617   The estimated effect is negative and significant, $-0.7392$! It seems like the the new machines were not a good investment, and the returns have decreased by $74%$.\nThis result seems to contradict our previous estimates. We have seen before that the revenue has increased on average more than the cost ($0.9505$ vs $0.5076$). Why is it the case? The problem is that we are giving the same weight to heavy users and light users. Let\u0026rsquo;s use a simple example with two users. The first one (blue) is a light user and before was costing $1$ $ and returning $10$ $, while now is costing $4$ $ and returning $20$ $. The other user (violet) is a heavy user and before was costing $10$ $ and returning $100$ $ and now is costing $20$ $ and returning $220$ $.\nThe average return is -3x: on average the return per user has decreased by $300%$. However, the total return per user is $1000%$: the increase in cost of $13$$ has generated $130$$ in revenue! The results are wildly different and entirely driven by the weight of the two users: the effect of the heavy user is low in relative terms but high in absolute terms, while it\u0026rsquo;s the opposite for the light user. The average relative effect is therefore mostly driven by the light user, while the relative average effect is mostly driven by the heavy user.\nWhich metric is more relevant in our setting? We talking about return on investment, we are usually interested in understanding whether we got a return on the money we spend. Therefore, the total return is more interesting than the average return.\nFrom now on, the object of interest will be the return on investment (ROI), given by the expected increase in revenue over the expected increase in cost, and we will denote it with the greek letter rho, $\\rho$.\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\text{incremental revenue}}{\\text{incremental cost}} = \\frac{\\mathbb E [\\Delta R]}{\\mathbb E [\\Delta C]} $$\nWe can estimate the ROI as the ratio of the two previous estimates: the average difference in revenue between the treatment and control group, over the average difference in cost between the treatment and control group.\n$$ \\hat{\\rho} = \\frac{\\mathbb E_n [\\Delta R]}{\\mathbb E_n [\\Delta C]} $$\nNote a subtle but crucial difference with respect to the previous formula: we have replaced the expected values $\\mathbb E$ with the empirical expectation operators $\\mathbb E_n$, also known as the sample average. The difference in notation is minimal, but the conceptual difference is huge. The first, $\\mathbb E$, is a theoretical concept, while the second, $\\mathbb E_n$, is empirical: it is a number that depends on the actual data. I personally like the notation since it highlights the close link between the two concepts (the second is the empirical counterpart of the first), while also making it clear that the second crucially depends on the sample size $n$.\ndef estimate_roi(df): Delta_C = df.loc[df.new_machine==1, \u0026quot;cost\u0026quot;].mean() - df.loc[df.new_machine==0, \u0026quot;cost\u0026quot;].mean() Delta_R = df.loc[df.new_machine==1, \u0026quot;revenue\u0026quot;].mean() - df.loc[df.new_machine==0, \u0026quot;revenue\u0026quot;].mean() return Delta_R / Delta_C estimate_roi(df)  2.0698235970047887  The estimate is $2.0698$: each additional dollar spent in the new machines translated in $2.0698$ extra dollars in revenue. Sounds great!\nBut how much should we trust this number? Is it significantly different form one, or it is just driven by noise?\nInference To answer this question, we would like to compute a confidence interval for our estimate. How do we compute a confidence interval for a ratio metric? The first step is to compute the standard deviation of the estimator. One method that is always available is the bootstrap: resample the data with replacement multiple times and use the distribution of the estimates over samples to compute the standard deviation of the estimator.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try it in our case. I compute the standard deviation over $10.000$ bootstrapped samples, using the function pd.DataFrame().sample() with the options frac=1 to obtain a dataset of the same size and replace=True to sample with replacement.\nboot_estimates = [estimate_roi(df.sample(frac=1, replace=True, random_state=i)) for i in range(10_000)] np.std(boot_estimates)  0.9790730538161984  The bootstrap estimate of the standard deviation is equal to $0.979$. How good is it?\nSince we fully control the data generating process, we can simulate the \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; distribution of the estimator. We do that for $10.000$ simulations and we compute the resulting standard deviation of the estimator.\nnp.std(dgp.evaluate_f_redrawing_outcomes(estimate_roi, 10_000))  1.0547776958025372  The estimated variance of the estimator using the \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; data generating process is slightly higher but very similar, around $1.055$.\nThe issue with the bootstrap is that it is very computational intense since it requires repeating the estimating procedure thousands of times. We are now going to explore another extremely powerful alternative that requires a single estimation step, the delta method. The delta method generally allows us to do inference on functions of random variable, therefore its applications are broader than ratios.\n⚠️ Warning: the next section is going to be algebra-intense. If you want, you can skip it and go straight to the last section.\nThe Delta Method What is the delta method? In short, it is an incredibly powerful asymptotic inference method for functions of random variables, that exploits Taylor expansions. In short, the delta method requires four ingredients\n One or more random variables A function The Central Limit Theorem Taylor expansions  I will assume some basic knowledge of all four concepts. Suppose we had a set of realizations $X_1$, \u0026hellip;, $X_n$ of a random variable that satisfy the requirements for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT): independence, identically distributions with expected value $\\mu$, and finite variance $\\sigma^2$. Under these conditions, the CLT tells us that the sample average $\\mathbb E_n[X]$ converges in distribution to a normal distribution, or more precisely\n$$ \\sqrt{n} \\ \\frac{ \\mathbb E_n[X] - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\ \\overset{D}{\\to} \\ N(0, 1) $$\nWhat does the equation mean? It reads \u0026ldquo;the normalized sample average, scaled by a factor $\\sqrt{n}$, converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution, i.e. it is approximately Gaussian for a sufficiently large sample.\nNow, suppose we were interested in a function of the sample average $f\\big(\\mathbb E_n[X]\\big)$. Note that this is different from the sample average of the function $\\mathbb E_n\\big[f(X)\\big]$. The delta method tells us what the function of the sample average converges to.\n$$ \\sqrt{n} \\ \\frac{ f\\big(\\mathbb E_n[X]\\big) - f(\\mu)}{\\sigma} \\ \\overset{D}{\\to} \\ N \\big(0, f'(\\mu)^2 \\big) $$\n, where $f'(\\mu)^2$ is the derivative of the function $f$, evaluated at $\\mu$.\nWhat is the intuition behind this formula? We now have a new term inside the expression of the variance, the squared first derivative $f'(\\mu)^2$ ($\\neq$ second derivative). If the derivative of the function is low, the variance decreases since different inputs translate into similar outputs. On the contrary, if the derivative of the function is high, the variance of the distribution is amplified, since different inputs translate into even more different outputs.\nThe result directly follows from the Taylor approximation of $f \\big(\\mathbb E_n[X]\\big)$\n$$ f\\big(\\mathbb E_n[X]\\big) = f(\\mu) + f'(\\mu) (\\mathbb E_n[X] - \\mu) + \\text{residual} $$\nImportantly, asymptotically, the last term disappears and the linear approximation holds exactly!\nHow is this connected to the ratio estimator? We need a bit more math and to switch from a single dimension to two dimensions in order to understand that. In our case, we have a bivariate function of two random variables, $\\Delta R$ and $\\Delta C$, which returns their ratio. In the case of a multivariate function $f$, the asymptotic variance of the estimator is given by\n$$ \\text{AVar} \\big( \\hat{\\rho} \\big) = \\nabla \\hat{\\rho}' \\Sigma_n \\nabla \\hat{\\rho} $$\nwhere, $\\nabla$ indicates the gradient of the function, i.e. the vector of directional derivatives, and $\\Sigma_n$ is the empirical variance-covariance matrix of $X$. In our case, they correspond to\n$$ \\nabla \\hat{\\rho} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\mathbb E_n [\\Delta C]} \\newline - \\frac{\\mathbb E_n [\\Delta R]}{\\mathbb E_n [\\Delta C]^2} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nand\n$$ \\Sigma_n = \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{Var}_n (\\Delta R) \u0026amp; \\text{Cov}_n (\\Delta R, \\Delta C) \\newline \\text{Cov}_n (\\Delta R, \\Delta C) \u0026amp; \\text{Var}_n (\\Delta C) \\newline \\end{bmatrix} $$\n, where the subscripts $n$ indicate the empirical counterparts, as for the expected value.\nCombining the previous three equations together with a little matrix algebra, we get the formula of the asymptotic variance of the return on investment estimator.\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\text{AVar} \\big( \\hat{\\rho} \\big) \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta C]^2} \\text{Var}_n(\\Delta R) - 2 \\frac{\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta R]}{\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta C]^3} \\text{Cov}_n(\\Delta R, \\Delta C) + \\frac{\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta R]^2}{\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta C]^4} \\text{Var}_n(\\Delta C) \\end{align*} $$\nSince the estimator is given by $\\hat{\\rho} = \\frac{\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta R]}{\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta C]}$, we can rewrite the asymptotic variance as\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\text{AVar} \\big( \\hat{\\rho} \\big) = \\frac{1}{\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta C]^2} \\text{Var}_n \\Big( \\Delta R - \\hat{\\rho} \\Delta C \\Big) \\end{align*} $$\nThe last expression is very interesting because it suggests that we can rewrite the asymptotic variance of our estimator as the variance of a difference-in-means estimator for a new auxiliary variable. In fact, we can rewrite the above expression as\n$$ \\begin{align*} \\text{AVar} \\big( \\hat{\\rho} \\big) = \\text{Var}_n \\Big( \\Delta \\tilde R \\Big) \\qquad \\text{where} \\quad \\tilde R = \\frac{R - \\hat{\\rho} \\ C}{| \\mathbb E [\\Delta C] |} \\end{align*} $$\nThis expression is incredibly useful because it gives us intuition and allows us to estimate the standard deviation of our estimator by linear regression.\nInference with Linear Regression Did you skip the previous section? No problem!\nAfter some algebra, we concluded that we can estimate the variance of a difference-in-means estimator for an auxiliary variable defined as\n$$ \\tilde R = \\frac{R - \\hat{\\rho} \\ C}{| \\mathbb E_n [\\Delta C] |} $$\nThis expression might seem obscure at first, but it is incredibly useful. In fact, it gives us (1) an intuitive interpretation of the variance of the estimator and (2) a practical way to estimate it.\nInterpretation first! How should we read the above expression? We can estimate the variance of the empirical estimator as the variance of a difference-in-means estimator, for a new variable $\\tilde R$ that we can easily compute from the data. We just need to take the revenue $R$, subtract the cost $C$ multiplied by the estimated ROI $\\rho$ and scale it down by the expected cost difference $|\\mathbb E_n[\\Delta C]|$. We can interpret this variable as the baseline revenue, i.e. the revenue not affected by the investment. The fact that it is scaled by the expected cost difference tells us that its variance will be decreasing in the total investment: the more we spend, the more precisely we can estimate the return on that expenditure.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s estimate the variance of the ROI estimator, in four steps.\n We need to estimate the return on investment $\\hat \\rho$.  rho_hat = estimate_roi(df)  The term $| \\mathbb E_n[\\Delta C] |$ is the absolute difference in average cost between the treatment and control group.  abs_Delta_C = np.abs(df.loc[df.new_machine==1, \u0026quot;cost\u0026quot;].mean() - df.loc[df.new_machine==0, \u0026quot;cost\u0026quot;].mean())  We now have all the ingredients to generate the auxiliary variable $\\tilde R$.  df['revenue_tilde'] = (df['revenue'] - rho_hat * df['cost']) / abs_Delta_C  The variance of the treatment-control difference $\\Delta \\tilde R$ can be directly computed by linear regression, as in randomized controlled trials for difference-in-means estimators (see Agrist and Pischke, 2008).  smf.ols('revenue_tilde ~ new_machine', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  38.4067  0.653  58.771  0.000  37.126  39.688   new_machine  -2.01e-14  0.917 -2.19e-14  1.000  -1.797  1.797   The estimated standard error of the ROI is $0.917$, very close to the bootstrap estimate of $0.979$ and the simulated value of $1.055$. However, with respect to bootstrapping, the delta method allowed us to compute it in a single step, making it sensibly faster (around $1000$ times on my local machine).\nNote that this estimated standard deviation implies a 95% confidence interval of $2.0698 +- 1.96 \\times 0.917$, equal to $[-0.2735, 3.8671]$. This might seem like good news since the confidence interval does not cover zero. However, note that in this case, a more interesting null hypothesis is that the ROI is equal to 1: we are breaking even. A value larger than 1 implies profits, while a value lower than 1 implies losses. In our case, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the investment in new machines was not profitable.\nConclusion In this article, we have explored a very common causal inference problem: assessing the return on investment. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s a physical investment in new hardware, a virtual cost, or advertisement expenditure, we are interested in understanding whether this incremental cost has paid off. The additional complications come from the fact that we are studying not one, but two causal quantities, intertwined.\nWe have first explored and compared different outcome metrics to assess whether the investment paid off. Then, we have introduced an incredibly powerful method to do inference with complex random variables: the delta method. In the particular case of ratios, the delta method delivers a very insightful and practical functional form for the asymptotic variance of the estimator that can be estimated with a simple linear regression.\nReferences [1] A.

The ATE is a very useful quantity since it tells us the effect that we can expect if we were to treat a new subject with the same treatment.\nHowever, sometimes we might be interested in quantities different from the average, such as the median. The median is an alternative measure of central tendency that is more robust to outliers and is often more informative with skewed distributions. More generally, we might want to estimate the effect for different quantiles of the outcome distribution. A common use-case is studying the impact of a UI change on the loading time of a website: a slightly heavier website might translate in an imperceptible change for most users, but a big change for a few users with very slow connections. Another common use-case is studying the impact of a product change on a product that is bought by few people: do existing customers buy it more or are we attracting new customers?\nThese questions are hard to answer with linear regression that estimates the average treatment effect. A more suitable tool is quantile regression that can instead estimate the median treatment effect. In this article we are going to cover a brief introduction to quantile regression and the estimation of quantile treatment effects.\nLoyalty Cards and Spending Suppose we were an online store and we wanted to increase sales. We decide to offer our customers a loyalty card that grants them discounts as they increase their spend in the store. We would like to assess if the loyalty card is effective in increasing sales so we run an A/B test: we offer the loyalty card only to a subset of our customers, at random.\nI import the data generating process dgp_loyalty() from src.dgp. I also import some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils. To include not only code but also data and tables, I use Deepnote, a Jupyter-like web-based collaborative notebook environment.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_loyalty  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the data. We have information on $10.000$ customers, for whom we observe their spend and whether they were offered the loyalty card. We also observe some demographics, like age and gender.\ndf = dgp_loyalty().generate_data() df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  loyalty spend age gender     0 1 0.0 30 Male   1 0 0.0 26 Male   2 1 0.0 27 Male   3 1 0.0 29 Male   4 1 0.0 23 Female     Interestingly, we notice that the outcome of interest, spend, seems to have a lot of zeros. Let\u0026rsquo;s dig deeper.\nMean vs Median Before analyzing our experiment, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at our outcome variable, spend. We first inspect it using centrality measures. We have two main options: the mean and the median.\nFirst of all, what are they? The mean captures the average value, while the median captures the value in the middle of the distribution. In general, the mean is mathematically more tractable and easier to interpret, while the median is more robust to outliers. You can find plenty of articles online comparing the two measures and suggesting which one is more appropriate and when. Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the mean and median spend.\nnp.mean(df['spend'])  28.136224  np.median(df['spend'])  0.0  How do we interpret these two numbers? People spend on average 28\\$ on our store. However, more than 50% of people don\u0026rsquo;t spend anything. As we can see, both measures are very informative and, to a certain extent, complementary. We can better understand the distribution of spend by plotting its histogram.\nsns.histplot(data=df, x=\u0026quot;spend\u0026quot;).set(ylabel='', title='Spending Distribution');  As previewed by the values of the mean and the median, the distribution of spend is very skewed, with more than 5000 customers (out of 10000) not spending anything.\nOne natural question then is: are we interested in the effect of the loyalty card on average spend or on median spend? The first would tell us if customers spend more on average, while the second would tell us if the average customer spends more.\nLinear regression can tell us the effect of the loyalty card on average spend. However, what can we do if we were interested in the effect of the loyalty card on median spend (or other quantiles)? The answer is quantile regression.\nQuantile Regression With linear regression, we try to estimate the conditional expectation function of an outcome variable $Y$ (spend in our example) with respect to one or more explanatory variables $X$ (loyalty in our example).\n$$ \\mathbb E \\big[ Y \\big| X \\big] $$\nIn other words, we want to find a function $f$ such that $f(X) = \\mathbb E[Y|X]$. We do so, by solving the following minimization problem:\n$$ \\hat f(X) = \\arg \\min_{f} \\mathbb E \\big[ Y - f(X) \\big]^2 $$\nIt can be shown that the function $f$ that solves this minimization is indeed the conditional expectation of $Y$, with respect to $X$.\nSince $f(X)$ can be infinite dimensional, we usually estimate a parametric form of $f(X)$. The most common one is the linear form $f(X) = \\beta X$, where $\\beta$ is estimated by solving the corresponding minimization problem:\n$$ \\hat \\beta = \\arg \\min_{\\beta} \\mathbb E \\big[ Y - \\beta X \\big]^2 $$\nThe linear form is not just convenient, but it can be interpreted as the best local approximation of $f(X)$, referring to Taylor\u0026rsquo;s expansion.\nWith quantile regression, we do the same. The only difference is that, instead of estimating the conditional expectation of $Y$ with respect to $X$, we want to estimate the $q$-quantile of $Y$ with respect to $X$.\n$$ \\mathbb Q_q \\big[ Y \\big| X \\big] $$\nFirst of all, what is a quantile? The Wikipedia definition says\n \u0026ldquo;In statistics and probability, quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way. Common quantiles have special names, such as quartiles (four groups), deciles (ten groups), and percentiles (100 groups).\u0026rdquo;\n For example, the 0.1-quantile represents the value that sits on the right of 10% of the mass of the distribution. The median is the 0.5-quantile (or, equivalently, the $50^{th}$ percentile or the $5^{th}$ decile) and corresponds with the value in the center of the distribution. Let\u0026rsquo;s see a simple example with a log-normal distribution. I plot the three quartiles that divide the data in four equally sized bins.\ndata = np.random.lognormal(0, 1, 1_000_000); sns.histplot(data).set(title='Lognormal Distribution', xlim=(0,10)) plt.axvline(x=np.percentile(data, 25), c='C8', label='25th percentile') plt.axvline(x=np.median(data), c='C1', label='Median (50th pct)') plt.axvline(x=np.percentile(data, 75), c='C3', label='75th percentile') plt.legend();  As we can see, the three quartiles divide the data into four bins, of equal size.\nSo, what is the objective of quantile regression? The objective is to find a function $f$ such that $f(X) = F^{-1}(y_q)$, where $F$ is the cumulative distribution function of $Y$ and $y_q$ is the $q$-quantile of the distribution of $Y$.\nHow do we do this? It can be shown with a little linear algebra that we can obtain the conditional quantile as the solution of the following minimization problem:\n$$ \\hat f(X) = \\arg \\min_{f} \\mathbb E \\big[ \\rho_q (Y - f(X)) \\big] = \\arg \\min_{f} \\ (1-q) \\int_{-\\infty}^{f(x)} (y - f(x)) \\text{d} F(y) + q \\int_{f(x)}^{\\infty} (y - f(x)) \\text{d} F(y) $$\nWhere $\\rho_q$ is an auxiliary weighting function with the following shape.\nWhat is the intuition behind the objective function?\nThe idea is that we can interpret the equation as follows\n$$ \\mathbb E \\big[ \\rho_q (Y - f(X)) \\big] = (1-q) \\underset{\\color{red}{\\text{mass of distribution below }f(x)}}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{f(x)} (y - f(x)) \\text{d} F(y)} + q \\underset{\\color{red}{\\text{mass of distribution above }f(x)}}{\\int_{f(x)}^{\\infty} (y - f(x)) \\text{d} F(y)} \\overset{\\color{blue}{\\text{if } f(x) = y_q}}{=} - (1-q) q + q (1-q) = 0 $$\nSo that, when $f(X)$ corresponds with the quantile $y_q$, the value of the objective function is zero.\nExactly as before, we can estimate a parametric form of $f$ and, exactly as before, we can interpret it as a best local approximation (not trivially though, see Angrist, Chernozhukov, and Fernández-Val (2006)).\n$$ \\hat \\beta_q = \\arg \\min_{\\beta} \\mathbb E \\big[ \\rho_q (Y - \\beta X ) \\big] $$\nWe wrote $\\hat \\beta_q$ to indicate that this is the coefficient for the best linear approximation of the conditional $q$-quantile function.\nHow do we estimate a quantile regression?\nEstimation The statsmodels package allows us to estimate quantile regression with the the quantreg() function. We just need to specify the quantile $q$ when we fit the model. Let\u0026rsquo;s use $q=0.5$, which corresponds with the median.\nsmf.quantreg(\u0026quot;spend ~ loyalty\u0026quot;, data=df).fit(q=0.5).summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  8.668e-07  0.153  5.66e-06  1.000  -0.300  0.300   loyalty  3.4000  0.217  15.649  0.000  2.974  3.826   Quantile regression estimates a positive coefficient for loyalty.

What does it mean? We will spend more time on the interpretation of quantile regression coefficients later.\nCan we condition the analysis on other variables? We suspect that spend is also affected by other variables and we want to increase the precision of our estimate by also conditioning the analysis on age and gender. We can just add the variables to the quantreg() model.\nsmf.quantreg(\u0026quot;spend ~ loyalty + age + gender\u0026quot;, data=df).fit(q=0.5).summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  -50.5353  1.053  -47.977  0.000  -52.600  -48.471   gender[T.Male]  -20.2963  0.557  -36.410  0.000  -21.389  -19.204   loyalty  4.5747  0.546  8.374  0.000  3.504  5.646   age  2.3663  0.026  92.293  0.000  2.316  2.417   The coefficient of loyalty increases when we condition the analysis on age and gender.

The first one is inference. How do we compute confidence intervals and p-values for our estimates in quantile regression?\nInference The asymptotic variance of the estimate $a$ of the quantile $q$ of a distribution $F$ is given by\n$$ AVar(y) = q(1-q) f^{-2}(y) $$\nwhere $f$ is the density function of $F$. This expression can be decomposed into two components: $q(1-q)$ and $f^{-2}(y)$.\nThe first component, $q(1-q)$, basically tells us that the variance of a quantile is higher the more the quantile is closer to the center of the distribution. Why is that so? First, we need to think about when the quantile of a point changes in response to a change in the value of a second point. The quantile changes when the second point swaps from left to right (or viceversa) of the first point. This is intuitively very easy if the first point lies in the middle of the distribution, but very hard if it lies at the extreme.\nThe second component, $f^{-2}(a)$, instead tells us that this side swapping is more likely if the first point is surrounded by a lot of points.\nImportantly, estimating the variance of a quantile requires an estimate of the whole distribution of $Y$. This is done via approximation and it can be computationally very intensive. However, alternative procedures like the bootstrap or the bayesian bootstrap are always available.\nThe second thing that we haven\u0026rsquo;t talked about yet is the interpretation of the estimated coefficients. We got a lower coefficient of loyalty on spend with median regression. What does it mean?\nInterpretation The interpretation of linear regression coefficients is straightforward: each coefficient is the derivative of the conditional expectation function $\\mathbb E[Y|X]$ with respect to one dimension of $X$. In our case, we can interpret the regression coefficient of loyalty as the average spend increase from being offered a loyalty card. Crucially, here \u0026ldquo;average\u0026rdquo; means that this holds true for each customer, on average.\nHowever, the interpretation of quantile regression coefficients is tricky. Before, we were tempted to say that the loyalty card increases the spend of the median customer by 3.4\\$. But what does it mean? Is it the same median customer that spends more or do we have a different median customer? This might seem like a philosophical question but it has important implications on reporting of quantile regression results. In the first case, we are making a statement that, as for the interpretation of linear regression coefficients, applies to a single individual. In the second case, we are making a statement about the distribution.\nChernozhukov and Hansen (2005) show that a strong but helpful assumption is rank invariance: assuming that the treatment does not shift the relative composition of the distribution. In other words, if we rank people by spend before the experiment, we assume that this ranking is not affected by the introduction of the loyalty card. If I was spending less than you before, I might spend more afterwards, but still less than you (for any two people).\nUnder this assumption, we can interpret the quantile coefficients as marginal effects for single individuals sitting at different points of the outcome distribution, as in the first interpretation provided above. Moreover, we can report the treatment effect for many quantiles and interpret each one of them as a local effect for a different individual. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the distribution of treatment effects, for different quantiles of spend.\ndef plot_quantile_TE(df, formula, q, varname): df_results = pd.DataFrame() for q in np.arange(q, 1-q, q): qreg = smf.quantreg(formula, data=df).fit(q=q) temp = pd.DataFrame({'q': [q], 'coeff': [qreg.params[varname]], 'std': [qreg.bse[varname]], 'ci_lower': [qreg.conf_int()[0][varname]], 'ci_upper': [qreg.conf_int()[1][varname]]}) df_results = pd.concat([df_results, temp]).reset_index(drop=True) # Plot fig, ax = plt.subplots() sns.lineplot(data=df_results, x='q', y='coeff') ax.fill_between(data=df_results, x='q', y1='ci_lower', y2='ci_upper', alpha=0.1); plt.axhline(y=0, c=\u0026quot;k\u0026quot;, lw=2, zorder=1) ols_coeff = smf.ols(formula, data=df).fit().params[varname] plt.axhline(y=ols_coeff, ls=\u0026quot;--\u0026quot;, c=\u0026quot;C1\u0026quot;, label=\u0026quot;OLS coefficient\u0026quot;, zorder=1) plt.legend() plt.title(\u0026quot;Estimated coefficient, by quantile\u0026quot;)  plot_quantile_TE(df, formula=\u0026quot;spend ~ loyalty\u0026quot;, varname='loyalty', q=0.05)  This plot is extremely insightful: for almost half of the customers, the loyalty card has no effect. On the other hand, customers that were already spending something end up spending even more (around 10/12\\$ more). This is a very powerful insight that we would have missed with linear regression that estimated an average effect of 5\\$.\nWe can repeat the same exercise, conditioning the analysis on gender and age.\nplot_quantile_TE(df, formula=\u0026quot;spend ~ loyalty + age + gender\u0026quot;, varname='loyalty', q=0.05)  Conditioning on other covariates removes a lot of the heterogeneity in treatment effects. The loyalty card increases spending for most people, it\u0026rsquo;s demographic characteristics that are responsible for no spending to begin with.\nConclusion In this article, we have explored a different causal estimand: median treatment effects. How does it compare with the average treatment effect that we usually estimate? The pros and cons are closely related to the pros and cons of the median with respect to the mean as a measure of central tendency. Median treatment effects are more informative on what is the effect on the average subject and are more robust to outliers. However, they are much more computationally intensive and they require strong assumptions for identification, such as rank invariance.\nReferences [1] R.

Assume we had $n$ observations and we just received the $n+1$th observation: the pair $(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$. In order to compute $\\hat{\\beta}_{n+1}$ we need to have stored only two objects in memory\n $\\hat{\\beta}_{n}$, the previous estimate of $\\beta$ $(X_n' X_n)^{-1}$, the previous value of $(X' X)^{-1}$  First of all, how do we update $(X' X)^{-1}$? $$ \\begin{align*} (X_{n+1}' X_{n+1})^{-1} = (X_n' X_n)^{-1} - \\frac{(X_n' X_n)^{-1} x_{n+1} x_{n+1}' (X_n' X_n)^{-1}}{1 + x_{n+1}' (X_n' X_n)^{-1} x_{n+1}} \\end{align*} $$\nAfter having updated $(X' X)^{-1}$, we can update $\\hat{\\beta}$. $$ \\hat{\\beta}{n+1} = \\hat{\\beta}{n} + (X_n' X_n)^{-1} x_{n} (y_n - x_n' \\hat{\\beta}_{n}) $$\nNote that this procedure is not only privacy friendly but also memory-friendly. Our dataset is a $100 \\times 4$ matrix while $(X' X)^{-1}$ is $3 \\times 3$ matrix and $\\beta$ is a $3 \\times 1$ matrix.

However, we cannot really start from the first observation, because we would be unable to invert the matrix $X\u0026rsquo;X$. We need at least $k+1$ observations, where $k$ is the number of variables in $X$.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use a warm start of 10 observations to be safe.\n# Initialize XiX and beta from first 10 observations x, y = xy_from_df(df, 0, 10) XiX = inv(x.T @ x) beta = XiX @ x.T @ y # Update estimate live for n in range(10, N): x, y = xy_from_df(df, n, n+1) XiX, beta = update_xb(XiX, beta, x, y) # Print result print(beta)  [ 6.07404291e+00 1.39385101e+00 -3.33599131e-03]  We got exactly the same coefficient!

The dynamic plotting function is a bit more cumbersome, but you can find it in src.figures.\nfrom src.figures import online_regression online_regression(df, \u0026quot;fig/online_reg1.gif\u0026quot;)  As we can see, as the number of data points increases, the estimate seems to less and less volatile.\nBut is it really the case? As usual, we are not just interested in the point estimate of the effect of the coupon on spending, we would also like to understand how precise this estimate is.\nInference We have seen how to estimate the treatment effect \u0026ldquo;online\u0026rdquo;: one observation at the time. Can we also compute the variance of the estimator in the same manner?\nFirst of all, let\u0026rsquo;s review what the variance of the OLS estimator looks like. Under baseline assumptions, the variance of the OLS estimator is given by: $$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{OLS}) = (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ is the variance of the residuals $e = (y - X'\\hat{\\beta})$.\nThe regression table reports the standard errors of the coefficients, which are the squared elements on the diagonal of $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta})$.\nmodel.summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  6.0740  1.079  5.630  0.000  3.933  8.215   treated  1.3939  1.297  1.075  0.285  -1.180  3.968   connection  -0.0033  0.017  -0.197  0.844  -0.037  0.030   Let\u0026rsquo;s check that we would obtain the same numbers using matrix algebra.\nbeta = inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ Y np.sqrt(np.diag(inv(X.T @ X) * np.var(Y - X @ beta)))  array([1.06261376, 1.27718352, 0.01669716])  Indeed, we get exactly the same numbers!\nWe already have a method to part of $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}{OLS})$ online: $(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}$ update the matrix $(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}$ online. How do we update $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$? This is the formula to update the sum of squared residuals $S$. $$ S{n+1} = S_{n} + \\frac{(y_{n+1} - x_{n+1}\\hat{\\beta}n)}{1 + x{n+1}' (X_n' X_n)^{-1} x_{n+1}} $$\ndef update_xbs(XiX, beta, S, x, y): S += (y - x @ beta)**2 / (1 + x @ XiX @ x.T ) XiX -= (XiX @ x.T @ x @ XiX) / (1 + x @ XiX @ x.T ) beta += XiX @ x.T @ (y - x @ beta) return XiX, beta, S[0,0]  Note, the order here is very important!\n# Inizialize XiX, beta, and sigma from the first 10 observations x, y = xy_from_df(df, 0, 10) XiX = inv(x.T @ x) beta = XiX @ x.T @ y S = np.sum((y - x @ beta)**2) # Update XiX, beta, and sigma online for n in range(10, N): x, y = xy_from_df(df, n, n+1) XiX, beta, S = update_xbs(XiX, beta, S, x, y) # Print result print(np.sqrt(np.diag(XiX * S / (N - 3))))  [1.0789208 1.29678338 0.0169534 ]  We indeed got the same result! Note that to get from the sum of squared residuals $S$ to the residuals variance $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ we need to divide by the degrees of freedom: $n - k = 100 - 3$.\nAs before we have plotted the evolution of the estimate of the OLS coefficient over time, we can now augment that plot with a confidence band of +- one standard deviation.\nonline_regression(df, \u0026quot;fig/online_reg2.gif\u0026quot;, ci=True)  As we can see, the estimated variance of the OLS estimator indeed decreases as the sample size increases.\nBootstrap So far we have used the asymptotic assumptions behind the Central Limit Theorem to compute the standard errors of the estimator. However, we have a particularly small sample. We further check the empirical distribution of the model residuals.\nsns.histplot(model.resid, bins=30);  The residuals seem to be particularly skewed! This might be a problem in such a small sample.\nOne alternative is the bootstrap. Instead of relying on asymptotics, we approximate the distribution of our estimator by resampling our dataset with replacement. Can we bootstrap online?\nThe answer is once again yes! They key is to weight each observation with an integer weight drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean (and variance) equal to 1. We repeat this process multiple times, in parallel and then we\nThe updating rules for $(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}$ and $\\hat{beta}$ become the following. $$ \\begin{align*} (X_{n+1}' X_{n+1})^{-1} = (X_n' X_n)^{-1} - \\frac{w (X_n' X_n)^{-1} x_{n+1} x_{n+1}' (X_n' X_n)^{-1}}{1 + w x_{n+1}' (X_n' X_n)^{-1} x_{n+1}} \\end{align*} $$\nand $$ \\hat{\\beta}{n+1} = \\hat{\\beta}{n} + w (X_n' X_n)^{-1} x_{n} (y_n - x_n' \\hat{\\beta}_{n}) $$\nwhere $w$ are Poisson weights. First, let\u0026rsquo;s update the updating function for $(X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}$ and $\\hat{beta}$.\ndef update_xbw(XiX, beta, w, x, y): XiX -= (w * XiX @ x.T @ x @ XiX) / (1 + w * x @ XiX @ x.T ) beta += w * XiX @ x.T @ (y - x @ beta) return XiX, beta  We can now run the online estimation. We bootstrap 1000 different estimates of $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n# Inizialize a vector of XiXs and betas np.random.seed(0) K = 1000 x, y = xy_from_df(df, 0, 10) XiXs = [inv(x.T @ x) for k in range(K)] betas = [xix @ x.T @ y for xix in XiXs] # Update the vector of XiXs and betas online for n in range(10, N): x, y = xy_from_df(df, n, n+1) for k in range(K): w = np.random.poisson(1) XiXs[k], betas[k] = update_xbw(XiXs[k], betas[k], w, x, y)  We can compute the estimated standard deviation of the treatment effect, simply by computing the standard deviation of the vector of bootstrapped coefficients.\nnp.std(betas, axis=0)  array([0.95301002, 1.14186364, 0.01207962])  The estimated standard errors are slightly different from the previous values of $[1.275, 1.532, 0.020]$, but not very far apart.\nLastly, some of you might have wondered \u0026ldquo;why sampling discrete weights and not continuous ones?\u0026rdquo;. Indeed, we can. This procedure is called the Bayesian Bootstrap and you can find a more detailed explanation here.\nConclusion In this post, we have seen hot to run an experiment without storing individual-level data. How are we able to do it? In order to compute the average treatment effect, we do not need every single observation but it\u0026rsquo;s sufficient to store just a more compact representation of it.\nReferences [1] W.

This is a broad term that is often misused or misunderstood. More broadly, we are often interested in understanding any observation is \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo;. First of all, what does it mean to be unusual? In this article we are going to inspect three different ways in which an observation can be unusual: it can be unusual characteristics, it might not fit the model or it might be particularly influential in fitting the model. We will see that in linear regression the latter characteristics is a byproduct of the first two.\nImportantly, being unusual is not necessarily bad. Observations that have different characteristics from all others usually carry more information. We also expect some observations not to fit the model well, otherwise the model is likely biased (overfitting). However, \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo; observations are also more likely to be generated by a different process. Extreme cases include measurement error or fraud, but differences can be more nuanced. Domain knowledge is always kind and dropping observations only for for statistical reasons is never wise.\nThat said, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at some different ways in which observations can be \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo;.\nExample Suppose we are an peer-to-peer online platform and we are interested in understanding if there is anything suspicious going on with our business. We have information about how much time our customers spend on the platform and the total value of their transactions.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at the data. I import the data generating process dgp_p2p() from src.dgp and some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils. I include code snippets from Deepnote, a Jupyter-like web-based collaborative notebook environment. For our purpose, Deepnote is very handy because it allows me not only to include code but also output, like data and tables.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_p2p  df = dgp_p2p().generate_data() df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  hours transactions     0 2.6 8.30   1 2.0 8.00   2 7.0 21.00   3 6.7 18.00   4 1.2 3.82     We have information on 50 clients for which we observe hours spent on the website and total transactions amount.

How?\nLeverage The first metric that we are going to use to evaluate \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo; observations is the leverage, which was first introduced by Cook (1980). The objective of the leverage is to capture how much a single point is different with respect to other data points. These data points are often called outliers and there exist a nearly amount of algorithms and rules of thumb to flag them.However the idea is the same: flagging observations that are unusual in terms of features.\nThe leverage of an observation $i$ is defined as\n$$ h_{ii} := x_i' (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} x_i $$\nOne interpretation of the leverage is as a measure of distance where individual observations are compared against the average of all observations.\nAnother interpretation of the leverage is as the influence of the outcome of observation $i$, $y_i$, on the corresponding fitted value $\\hat{y_i}$.\n$$ h_{ii} = \\frac{\\partial \\hat{y}_i}{\\partial y_i} $$\nAlgebraically, the leverage of observation $i$ is the $i^{th}$ element of the design matrix $X' (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} X$. Among the many properties of the leverages, is the fact that they are non-negative and their values sum to 1.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s compute the leverage of the observations in our dataset. We also flag observations that have unusual leverages (which we arbitrarily define as more than two standard deviations away from the average leverage).\nX = np.reshape(df['hours'].values, (-1, 1)) Y = np.reshape(df['transactions'].values, (-1, 1))  df['leverage'] = np.diagonal(X @ np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T) df['high_leverage'] = df['leverage'] \u0026gt; (np.mean(df['leverage']) + 2*np.std(df['leverage']))  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the distribution of leverage values in our data.\nfix, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 6)) sns.histplot(data=df, x='leverage', hue='high_leverage', alpha=1, bins=30, ax=ax1).set(title='Distribution of Leverages'); sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='hours', y='transactions', hue='high_leverage', ax=ax2).set(title='Data Scatterplot');  As we can see, the distribution is skewed with two observations having a unusually high leverage. Indeed, in the scatterplot these two observations are slightly separated from the rest of the distribution.\nIs this bad news? It depends. Outliers are not a problem per se. Actually, if they are genuine observations, they might carry much more information than other observations. On the other hand, they are also more likely not to be genuine observations (e.g. fraud, measurement error, \u0026hellip;) or to be inherently different from the other ones (e.g. professional users vs amateurs). In any case, we might want to investigate further and use as much context-specific information as we can.\nImportantly, the fact that an observation has a high leverage tells us information about the features of the model but nothing about the model itself. Are these users just different observations or they also behave differently?\nResiduals So far we have only talked about unusual features, but what about unusual behavior? This is what regression residuals measure.\nRegression residuals are the difference between the predicted outcome values and the observed outcome values. In a sense, they capture what the model cannot explain: the higher the residual of one observation the more it is unusual in the sense that the model cannot explain it.\nIn the case of linear regression, residuals can be written as\n$$ \\hat{e} = y - \\hat{y} = y - \\hat \\beta X $$\nIn our case, since $X$ is one dimensional (hours), we can easily visualize them.\nY_hat = X @ np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ Y  plt.scatter(X, Y, s=50, label='data') plt.plot(X, Y_hat, c='k', lw=2, label='prediction') plt.vlines(X, np.minimum(Y, Y_hat), np.maximum(Y, Y_hat), color='r', lw=3, label=\u0026quot;residuals\u0026quot;); plt.legend() plt.title(f\u0026quot;Regression prediction and residuals\u0026quot;);  Do some observations have unusually high residuals? Let\u0026rsquo;s plot their distribution.\ndf['residual'] = np.abs(Y - X @ np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ Y) df['high_residual'] = df['residual'] \u0026gt; (np.mean(df['residual']) + 2*np.std(df['residual']))  fix, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 6)) sns.histplot(data=df, x='residual', hue='high_residual', alpha=1, bins=30, ax=ax1).set(title='Distribution of Residuals'); sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='hours', y='transactions', hue='high_residual', ax=ax2).set(title='Data Scatterplot');  Two observations have particularly high residuals. This means that for these observations, the model is not good at predicting the observed outcomes.\nIs this bad news? Not necessarily. A model that fits the observations too well is likely to be biased. However, it might still be important to understand why some users have a different relationship between hours spent and total transactions. As usual, information on the specific context is key.\nSo far we have looked at observations with \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo; characteristics and \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo; model fit, but what is the observation itself is distorting the model? How much our model is driven by a handful of observations?\nInfluence The concept of influence and influence functions was developed precisely to answer this question: what are influential observations? This questions were very popular in the 80\u0026rsquo;s and lost appeal for a long time until the recent need of explaining complex machine learning and AI models.\nThe general idea is to define an observation as influential if removing it significantly changes the estimated model. In linear regression, we define the influence of observation $i$ as:\n$$ \\hat{\\beta} - \\hat{\\beta}_{-i} = (X\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1} x_i e_i $$\nWhere $\\hat{\\beta}_{-i}$ is the OLS coefficient estimated omitting observation $i$.\nAs you can see, there is a tight connection to both leverage $h_{ii}$ and residuals $e_i$: influence is almost the product of the two. Indeed, in linear regression, observations with high leverage are observations that are both outliers and have high residuals. None of the two conditions alone is sufficient for an observation to have an influence on the model.\nWe can see it best in the data.\ndf['influence'] = (np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T).T * np.abs(Y - Y_hat) df['high_influence'] = df['influence'] \u0026gt; (np.mean(df['influence']) + 2*np.std(df['influence']))  fix, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 6)) sns.histplot(data=df, x='influence', hue='high_influence', alpha=1, bins=30, ax=ax1).set(title='Distribution of Influences'); sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='hours', y='transactions', hue='high_influence', ax=ax2).set(title='Data Scatterplot');  In our dataset, there is only one observation with high influence, and it is disproportionally larger than the influence of all other observations.\nWe can now plot all \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo; points in the same plot. I also report residuals and leverage of each point in a separate plot.\ndef plot_leverage_residuals(df): # Hue df['type'] = 'Normal' df.loc[df['high_residual'], 'type'] = 'High Residual' df.loc[df['high_leverage'], 'type'] = 'High Leverage' df.loc[df['high_influence'], 'type'] = 'High Influence' # Init figure fig, (ax1,ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(12,5)) ax1.plot(X, Y_hat, lw=1, c='grey', zorder=0.5) sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='hours', y='transactions', ax=ax1, hue='type').set(title='Data') sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='residual', y='leverage', hue='type', ax=ax2).set(title='Metrics') ax1.get_legend().remove() sns.move_legend(ax2, \u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;, bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 0.8));  plot_leverage_residuals(df)  As we can see, we have one point with high residual and low leverage, one with high leverage and low residual and only one point with both high leverage and high residual: the only influential point.\nFrom the plot it is also clear why none of the two conditions alone is sufficient for an observation to rive the model. The orange point has high residual but it lies right in the middle of the distribution and therefore cannot tilt the line of best fit. The green point instead has high leverage and lies far from the center of the distribution but its perfectly aligned with the line of fit. Removing it would not change anything. The red dot instead is different from the others in terms of both characteristics and behavior and therefore tilts the fit line towards itself.\nConclusion In this post, we have seen some different ways in which observations can be \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo;: they can have either unusual characteristics or unusual behavior. In linear regression, when an observation has both it is also influential: it tilts the model towards itself.\nIn the example of the article, we concentrated on a univariate linear regression. However, research on influence functions has recently become a hot topic because of the need to make black-box machine learning algorithms understandable. With models with millions of parameters, billions of observations and wild non-linearities, it can be very hard to establish whether a single observation is influential and how.\nReferences [1] D.

The most frequent setting is the computation of quantities that are not sums or averages, such as the median treatment effect, for example. In these cases, we cannot rely on the central limit theorem. What can we do then?\nThe bootstrap is the answer! It is a very powerful procedure to compute the distribution of an estimator, without needing any knowledge of the data generating process. It is also very intuitive and simple to implement: just re-sample your data with replacement a lot of times and compute your estimator on the re-computed sample.\nCan we do better? The answer is yes! The Bayesian Bootstrap is a powerful procedure that in a lot of setting performs better than the bootstrap. In particular, it\u0026rsquo;s usually faster, can give tighter confidence intervals and prevents a lot of corner cases of the bootstrap. In this article we are going to explore this simple but powerful procedure more in detail.\nThe Bootstrap Bootstrap is a procedure to compute properties of an estimator by random re-sampling with replacement from the data. It was first introduced by Efron (1979). The procedure is very simple and consists in the following steps.\nSuppose you have access to an i.i.d. sample $\\lbrace X_i \\rbrace_{i=1}^n$ and you want to compute a statistic $\\theta$ using an estimator $\\hat \\theta(X)$. You can approximate the distribution of $\\hat \\theta$ by\n Sample $n$ observations with replacement from your sample $\\lbrace \\tilde X_i \\rbrace_{i=1}^n$ Compute the estimator $\\hat \\theta_{bootstrap}(\\tilde X)$ Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times  The distribution of $\\hat \\theta_{bootstrap}$ is a good approximation of the distribution of $\\hat \\theta$.\nWhy is the bootstrap so powerful?\nFirst of all, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to implement. It does not require you to do anything more than what you were already doing: estimating $\\theta$. You just need to do it a lot of times. Indeed, the main disadvantage of the bootstrap is its computational speed. If estimating $\\theta$ once is slow, bootstrapping it is prohibitive.\nSecond, the bootstrap makes no distributional assumption. It only assumes a representative sample from your population, where observations are independent from each other. This assumption might be violated when observations are tightly connected with each other, such when studying social networks.\nIs bootstrap just weighting?\nIn the end, what we are doing is assigning integer weights to our observations, such that their sum adds up to $n$. Such distribution is the multinomial distribution.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s have a look at what a multinomial distribution look like by drawing a sample of size 10.000.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import *  N = 10_000 np.random.seed(1) bootstrap_weights = np.random.multinomial(N, np.ones(N)/N) np.sum(bootstrap_weights)  10000  First of all, we check that indeed the weights sum up to 1000, or equivalently, we generated a re-sample of the same size of the data.\nWe can now plot the distribution of weights.\nsns.countplot(bootstrap_weights, color='C0').set(title='Bootstrap Weights');  As we can see, around 3600 observations got zero weight, however a couple of observations got a weights of 6. Or equivalently, around 3600 observations did not get re-sampled while a couple of observations got samples as many as 6 times.\nNow you might have a spontaneous question: why not use continuous weights instead of discrete ones?\nVery good question! The Bayesian Bootstrap is the answer.\nThe Bayesian Bootstrap The Bayesian bootstrap was introduced by Rubin (1981) and it\u0026rsquo;s based on a very simple idea: why not draw a smoother distribution of weights? The continuous equivalent of the multinomial distribution is the Dirichelet distribution. Below I plot the probability distribution of Multinomial and Dirichelet weights for a single observation (they are Poisson and Gamma distributed, respectively).\nfrom scipy.stats import gamma, poisson x1 = np.arange(0, 8, 0.001) x2 = np.arange(0, 8, 1) sns.barplot(x2, poisson.pmf(x2, mu=1), color='C0', label='Multinomial Weights'); plt.plot(x1, gamma.pdf(x1, a=1.0001), color='C1', label='Dirichlet Weights'); plt.legend() plt.title('Distribution of Bootstrap Weights');  The Bayesian Bootstrap has many advantages.\n The first and most intuitive one is that it delivers estimates that are much more smooth than the normal bootstrap, because of its continuous weighting scheme. Moreover, the continuous weighting scheme prevents corner cases from emerging, since no observation will ever receive zero weight. For example, in linear regression, no problem of collinearity emerges, if there wasn\u0026rsquo;t one in the original sample. Lastly, being a Bayesian method, we gain interpretation: the estimated distribution of the estimator can be interpreted as the posterior distribution with an uninformative prior.  Let\u0026rsquo;s now draw a set a Dirichlet weights.\nbayesian_weights = np.random.dirichlet(alpha=np.ones(N), size=1)[0] * N np.sum(bayesian_weights)  10000.000000000005  The weights naturally sum to (approximately) 1, so we have to scale them by a factor N.\nAs before, we can plot the distribution of weights, with the difference that now we have continuous weights, so we have to approximate the distribution.\nsns.histplot(bayesian_weights, color='C1').set(title='Dirichlet Weights');  As you might have noticed, the Dirichelet distirbution has a parameter $\\alpha$ that we have set to 1 for all observations. What does it do?\nThe $\\alpha$ parameter essentially governs both the absolute and relative probability of being samples. Increasing $\\alpha$ for all observations makes the distribution less skewed so that all observations have a more similar weight. For $\\alpha \\to \\infty$, all observations receiver the same weight and we are back to the original sample.\nHow should we pick $\\alpha$? Shao and Tu (1995) suggest the following.\n The distribution of the random weight vector does not have to be restricted to the Diri(l, \u0026hellip; , 1). Later investigations found that the weights having a scaled Diri(4, \u0026hellip; ,4) distribution give better approximations (Tu and Zheng, 1987)\n Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at how a Dirichelet distribution with $\\alpha = 4$ for all observations compare to our previous distribution with $\\alpha = 1$ for all observations.\nbayesian_weights2 = np.random.dirichlet(np.ones(N) * 4, 1)[0] * N sns.histplot(bayesian_weights, color='C1') sns.histplot(bayesian_weights2, color='C2').set(title='Comparing Dirichlet Weights'); plt.legend([r'$\\alpha = 1$', r'$\\alpha = 4$']);  The new distribution is much less skewed and more concentrated around the average value of 1.\nExamples Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at a couple of examples, where we compare both inference procedures.\nMean of a Skewed Distribution First, let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at one of the simplest and most common estimators: the sample mean.\nnp.random.seed(2) X = pd.Series(np.random.pareto(2, 100)) sns.histplot(X).set(title='Sample from Pareto Distribution');  def classic_boot(df, estimator, seed=1): df_boot = df.sample(n=len(df), replace=True, random_state=seed) estimate = estimator(df_boot) return estimate  classic_boot(X, np.mean)  0.7079805545831946  def bayes_boot(df, estimator, seed=1): np.random.seed(seed) w = np.random.dirichlet(np.ones(len(df)), 1)[0] result = estimator(df, weights=w) return result  bayes_boot(X, np.average)  1.0378495251293498  from joblib import Parallel, delayed def bootstrap(boot_method, df, estimator, K): r = Parallel(n_jobs=8)(delayed(boot_method)(df, estimator, seed=i) for i in range(K)) return r  def compare_boot(df, boot1, boot2, estimator, title, K=1000): s1 = bootstrap(boot1, df, estimator, K) s2 = bootstrap(boot2, df, estimator, K) df = pd.DataFrame({'Estimate': s1 + s2, 'Estimator': ['Classic']*K + ['Bayes']*K}) sns.histplot(data=df, x='Estimate', hue='Estimator') plt.legend([f'Bayes: {np.mean(s2):.2f} ({np.std(s2):.2f})', f'Classic: {np.mean(s1):.2f} ({np.std(s1):.2f})']) plt.title(f'Bootstrap Estimates of {title}')  compare_boot(X, classic_boot, bayes_boot, np.average, 'Sample Mean')  In this setting, both procedures give a very similar answer.\nWhich one is faster?\nimport time def compare_time(df, boot1, boot2, estimator, K=1000): t1, t2 = np.zeros(K), np.zeros(K) for k in range(K): # Classic bootstrap start = time.time() boot1(df, estimator) t1[k] = time.time() - start # Bayesian bootstrap start = time.time() boot2(df, estimator) t2[k] = time.time() - start print(f\u0026quot;Bayes wins {np.mean(t1 \u0026gt; t2)*100}% of the time (by {np.mean((t1 - t2)/t1*100):.2f}%)\u0026quot;)  compare_time(X, classic_boot, bayes_boot, np.average)  Bayes wins 99.8% of the time (by 82.89%)  The Bayesian bootstrap is faster than the classical bootstrap 100% of the simulations, and by an impressive 83%!\nNo Weighting? No Problem What if we have an estimator that does not accept weights, such as the median? We can do two-level sampling.\ndef twolv_boot(df, estimator, seed=1): np.random.seed(seed) w = np.random.dirichlet(np.ones(len(df))*4, 1)[0] df_boot = df.sample(n=len(df)*10, replace=True, weights=w, random_state=seed) result = estimator(df_boot) return result  np.random.seed(1) X = pd.Series(np.random.normal(0, 10, 1000)) compare_boot(X, classic_boot, twolv_boot, np.median, 'Sample Median')  In this setting, the Bayesian Bootstrap is also more precise than the classical bootstrap.\nLogistic Regression with Rare Outcome Let\u0026rsquo;s now explore the first of two settings in which the classical bootstrap might fall into corner cases. Suppose we observed a feature $x$, normally distributed, and a binary outcome $y$. We are interested in the relationship between the two variables.\nN = 100 np.random.seed(1) x = np.random.normal(0, 1, N) y = np.rint(np.random.normal(x, 1, N) \u0026gt; 2) df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y}) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  x y     0 1.624345 0.0   1 -0.611756 0.0   2 -0.528172 0.0   3 -1.072969 0.0   4 0.865408 0.0     In this case, we observe a positive outcome only in 10 observations out of 100.\nnp.sum(df['y'])  10.0  Since the outcome is binary, we fit a logistic regression model.\nsmf.logit('y ~ x', data=df).fit(disp=False).summary().tables[1]    coef std err z P|z| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  -4.0955  0.887  -4.618  0.000  -5.834  -2.357   x  2.7664  0.752  3.677  0.000  1.292  4.241   Can we bootstrap the distribution of our estimator? Let\u0026rsquo;s try to compute the logistic regression coefficient over 1000 bootstrap samples.\nestimate_logit = lambda df: smf.logit('y ~ x', data=df).fit(disp=False).params[1] for i in range(1000): try: classic_boot(df, estimate_logit, seed=i) except Exception as e: print(f'Error for bootstrap number {i}: {e}')  Error for bootstrap number 92: Perfect separation detected, results not available Error for bootstrap number 521: Perfect separation detected, results not available Error for bootstrap number 545: Perfect separation detected, results not available Error for bootstrap number 721: Perfect separation detected, results not available Error for bootstrap number 835: Perfect separation detected, results not available  For 5 samples out of 1000, we are unable to compute the estimate. This would not have happened with then bayesian bootstrap.\nThis might seem like an innocuous issue in this case: we can just drop those observations. Let\u0026rsquo;s conclude with a much more dangerous example.\nSuppose we observed a binary feature $x$ and a continuous outcome $y$. We are again interested in the relationship between the two variables.\nN = 100 np.random.seed(1) x = np.random.binomial(1, 5/N, N) y = np.random.normal(1 + 2*x, 1, N) df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y}) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  x y     0 0 1.315635   1 0 -1.022201   2 0 0.693796   3 0 1.827975   4 0 1.230095     Let\u0026rsquo;s compare the two bootstrap estimators of the regression coefficient of $y$ on $x$.\nestimate_beta = lambda df, **kwargs: smf.wls('y ~ x', data=df, **kwargs).fit().params[1] compare_boot(df, classic_boot, bayes_boot, estimate_beta, 'beta')  The classic bootstrap procedure estimates a 50% larger variance of our estimator. Why? If we look more closely, we seen that in almost 20 re-samples, we get a very unusual estimate of zero!\nThe problem is that in some samples we might not have have any observations with $x=1$. Therefore, in these re-samples, the estimated coefficient is zero. This does not happen with the Bayesian bootstrap, since it does not drop any observation.\nThe problematic part here is that we are not getting any error message or warning. This bias is very sneaky and could easily go unnoticed!\nConclusion The article was inspired by the following tweet by Brown University professor Peter Hull\nOk, so I come bearing good news for ~93% of you: esp. those bootstraping complex models (e.g. w/many FEs)\nInstead of resampling, which can be seen as reweighting by a random integer W that may be zero, you can reweight by a random non-zero non-integer W https://t.co/Rpm1GmomHg\n\u0026mdash; Peter Hull (@instrumenthull) January 29, 2022  Indeed, besides being a simple and intuitive procedure, the Bayesian Bootstrap is not part of the standard econometrics curriculum in economic graduate schools.\nReferences [1] B.

We randomly split a set of subjects (patients, users, customers, \u0026hellip;) into a treatment and a control group and give the treatment to the treatment group. This procedure ensures that, ex-ante, the only expected difference between the two groups is caused by the treatment.\nOne of the key assumptions in AB testing is that there is no contamination between treatment and control group. Giving a drug to one patient in the treatment group does not affect the health of patients in the control group. This might not be the case for example if we are twying to cure a contageous disease and the two groups are not isolated. In the industry, frequent violations of the contamination assumption are network effects - my utility of using a social network increases as the number of friends on the network increases - and general equilibrium effects - if I improve one product, it might decrease the sales of another similar product.\nBecause of this reason, often experiments are carried out at a sufficiently large scale so that there is no contamination across groups, such as cities, states or even countries. Then another problem arises because of the larger scale: the treatment becomes more expensive. Giving a drug to 50% of patients in a hospital is much less expensive than giving a drug to 50% of cities in a country. Therefore, often only few units are treated but often over a longer period of time.\nIn these settings, a very powerful method emerged around 10 years age: Synthetic Control. The idea of synthetic control is to exploit the temporal variation in the data instead of the cross-sectional one (across time instead of across units). This method is extremely popular in the industry - e.g. in companies like Google, Uber, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon - because it is easy to interpret and deals with a setting that emerges often at large scales. In this post we are going to explore this technique by means of example: we will investigate the effectiveness of self-driving cars for a ride-sharing platform.\nSelf-Driving Cars Suppose you were a ride-sharing platform and you wanted to test the effect of self-driving cars in your fleet.\nAs you can imagine, there are many limitations to running an AB/test for this type of feature. First of all, it\u0026rsquo;s complicated to randomize individual rides. Second, it\u0026rsquo;s a very expensive intervention. Third, and statistically most important, you cannot run this intervention at the ride level. The problem is that there are spillover effects from treated to control units: if indeed self-driving cars are more efficient, it means that they can serve more customers in the same amount of time, reducing the customers available to normal drivers (the control group). This spillover contaminates the experiment and prevents a causal interpretation of the results.\nFor all these reasons, we select only one city. Given the synthetic vibe of the article we cannot but select\u0026hellip; (drum roll)\u0026hellip; Miami!\nI generate a simulated dataset in which we observe a panel of U.S. cities over time. The revenue data is made up, while the socio-economic variables are taken from the OECD database. I import the data generating process dgp_selfdriving() from src.dgp. I also import some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_selfdriving treatment_year = 2013 treated_city = 'Miami' df = dgp_selfdriving().generate_data(year=treatment_year, city=treated_city) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  city year density employment gdp population treated post revenue     0 Atlanta 2003 290 0.629761 6.4523 4.267538 False False 25.713947   1 Atlanta 2004 295 0.635595 6.5836 4.349712 False False 23.852279   2 Atlanta 2005 302 0.645614 6.6998 4.455273 False False 24.332397   3 Atlanta 2006 313 0.648573 6.5653 4.609096 False False 23.816017   4 Atlanta 2007 321 0.650976 6.4184 4.737037 False False 25.786902     We have information on the largest 46 U.S. cities for the period 2002-2019. The panel is balanced, which means that we observe all cities for all time periods. Self-driving cars were introduced in 2013.\nIs the treated unit, Miami, comparable to the rest of the sample? Let\u0026rsquo;s use the create_table_one function from Uber\u0026rsquo;s causalml package to produce a covariate balance table, containing the average value of our observable characteristics, across treatment and control groups. As the name suggests, this should always be the first table you present in causal inference analysis.\nfrom causalml.match import create_table_one create_table_one(df, 'treated', ['density', 'employment', 'gdp', 'population', 'revenue'])   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Control Treatment SMD   Variable        n 765 17    density 256.63 (172.90) 364.94 (19.61) 0.8802   employment 0.63 (0.05) 0.60 (0.04) -0.5266   gdp 6.07 (1.16) 5.12 (0.29) -1.1124   population 3.53 (3.81) 5.85 (0.31) 0.861   revenue 25.25 (2.45) 23.86 (2.39) -0.5737     As expected, the groups are not balanced: Miami is more densely populated, poorer, larger and has lower employment rate than the other cities in the US in our sample.\nWe are interested in understanding the impact of the introduction of self-driving cars on revenue.\nOne initial idea could be to analyze the data as we would in an A/B test, comparing control and treatment group. We can estimate the treatment effect as a difference in means in revenue between the treatment and control group, after the introduction of self-driving cars.\nsmf.ols('revenue ~ treated', data=df[df['post']==True]).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  26.6006  0.127  210.061  0.000  26.351  26.850   treated[T.True]  -0.7156  0.859  -0.833  0.405  -2.405  0.974   The effect of self-driving cars seems to be negative but not significant.\nThe main problem here is that treatment was not randomly assigned. We have a single treated unit, Miami, and it\u0026rsquo;s hardly comparable to other cities.\nOne alternative procedure, is to compare revenue before and after the treatment, within the city of Miami.\nsmf.ols('revenue ~ post', data=df[df['city']==treated_city]).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  22.4485  0.534  42.044  0.000  21.310  23.587   post[T.True]  3.4364  0.832  4.130  0.001  1.663  5.210   The effect of self-driving cars seems to be positive and statistically significant.\nHowever, the problem of this procedure is that there might have been many other things happening after 2013. It\u0026rsquo;s quite a stretch to attribute all differences to self-driving cars.\nWe can better understand this concern if we plot the time trend of revenue over cities. First, we need to reshape the data into a wide format, with one column per city and one row per year.\ndf = df.pivot(index='year', columns='city', values='revenue').reset_index()  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s plot the revenue over time for Miami and for the other cities.\ncities = [c for c in df.columns if c!='year'] df['Other Cities'] = df[[c for c in cities if c != treated_city]].mean(axis=1)  def plot_lines(df, line1, line2, year, hline=True): sns.lineplot(x=df['year'], y=df[line1].values, label=line1) sns.lineplot(x=df['year'], y=df[line2].values, label=line2) plt.axvline(x=year, ls=\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;, color='C2', label='Self-Driving Cars', zorder=1) plt.legend(); plt.title(\u0026quot;Average revenue per day (in M$)\u0026quot;);  Since we are talking about Miami, let\u0026rsquo;s use an appropriate color palette.\nsns.set_palette(sns.color_palette(['#f14db3', '#0dc3e2', '#443a84']))  plot_lines(df, treated_city, 'Other Cities', treatment_year)  As we can see, revenue seems to be increasing after the treatment in Miami. But it\u0026rsquo;s a very volatile time series. And revenue was increasing also in the rest of the country. It\u0026rsquo;s very hard from this plot to attribute the change to self-driving case.\nCan we do better?\nSynthetic Control The answer is yes! Synthetic control allow us to do causal inference when we have as few as one treated unit and many control units and we observe them over time. The idea is simple: combine untreated units so that they mimic the behavior of the treated unit as closely as possible, without the treatment. Then use this \u0026ldquo;synthetic unit\u0026rdquo; as a control. The method first introduced by Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller (2010) and has been called \u0026ldquo;the most important innovation in the policy evaluation literature in the last few years\u0026rdquo;. Moreover, it is widely used in the industry because of its simplicity and interpretability.\nSetting We assume that for a panel of i.i.d. subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ over time $t=1, \u0026hellip;,T$ we observed a set of variables $(X_{it}, D_i, Y_{it})$ that includes\n a treatment assignment $D_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ (treated) a response $Y_{i,t} \\in \\mathbb R$ (revenue) a feature vector $X_{i,t} \\in \\mathbb R^n$ (population, density, employment and GDP)  Moreover, one unit (Miami in our case) is treated at time $t^*$ (2013 in our case). We distinguish time periods before treatment and time periods after treatment.\nCrucially, treatment $D_i$ is not randomly assigned, therefore a difference in means between the treated unit(s) and the control group is not an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect.\nThe Problem The problem is that, as usual, we do not observe the counterfactual outcome for treated units, i.e. we do not know what would have happened to them, if they had not been treated. This is known as the fundamental problem of causal inference.\nThe simplest approach, would be just to compare pre and post periods. This is called the event study approach.\nHowever, we can do better than this. In fact, even though treatment was not randomly assigned, we still have access to some units that were not treated.\nFor the outcome variable we observe the following values\n$$ Y = \\begin{bmatrix} Y^{(1)} _ {t, post} \\ \u0026amp; Y^{(0)} _ {c, post} \\newline Y^{(0)} _ {t, pre} \\ \u0026amp; Y^{(0)} _ {c, pre} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nWhere $Y^{(d)} _ {a, t}$ is the outcome of an observation at time $t$, given treatment assignment $a$ and treatment status $d$. We basically have a missing data problem since we do not observe $Y^{(0)} _ {t, post}$: what would have happened to treated units ($a=t$) without treatment ($d=0$).\nThe Solution Following Doudchenko and Inbens (2018), we can formulate an estimate of the counterfactual outcome for the treated unit as a linear combination of the observed outcomes for the control units.\n$$ \\hat Y^{(0)} _ {t, post} = \\alpha + \\sum_{i \\in c} \\beta_{i} Y^{(0)} _ {i, post} $$\nwhere\n the constant $\\alpha$ allows for different averages between the two groups the weights $\\beta_i$ are allowed to vary across control units $i$ (otherwise, it would be a difference-in-differences)  How should we choose which weights to use? We want our synthetic control to approximate the outcome as closely as possible, before the treatment. The first approach could be to define the weights as\n$$ \\hat \\beta = \\arg \\min_{\\beta} || \\boldsymbol X_{t, pre} - \\boldsymbol \\beta \\boldsymbol X_{c, pre} || = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{p} \\left( X_{t, p, pre} - \\sum_{i \\in c} \\beta_{p} X_{c, p, pre} \\right)^2 } $$\nI.e. the weights are such that they minimize the distance between observable characteristics of control units $X_c$ and the treated unit $X_t$ before the treatment.\nYou might notice a very close similarity to linear regression. Indeed, we are doing something very similar.\nIn linear regression, we usually have many units (observations), few exogenous features and one endogenous feature and we try to express the endogenous feature as a linear combination of the endogenous features, for each unit.\nWith synthetic control, we instead have many time periods (features), few control units and a single treated unit and we try to express the treated unit as a linear combination of the control units, for each time period.\nTo perform the same operation, we essentially need to transpose the data.\nAfter the swap, we compute the synthetic control weights, exactly as we would compute regression coefficients. However now one observation is a time period and one feature is a unit.\nNotice that this swap is not innocent. In linear regression we assume that the relationship between the exogenous features and the endogenous feature is the same across units, instead in synthetic control we assume that the relationship between the treated units and the control unit is the same over time.\nBack to self-driving cars Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the data now! First, we write a synth_predict function that takes as input a model that is trained on control cities and tries to predict the outcome of the treated city, Miami, before the introduction of self-driving cars.\ndef synth_predict(df, model, city, year): other_cities = [c for c in cities if c not in ['year', city]] y = df.loc[df['year'] \u0026lt;= year, city] X = df.loc[df['year'] \u0026lt;= year, other_cities] df[f'Synthetic {city}'] = model.fit(X, y).predict(df[other_cities]) return model  Let\u0026rsquo;s estimate the model via linear regression.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression coef = synth_predict(df, LinearRegression(), treated_city, treatment_year).coef_  How well did we match pre-self-driving cars revenue in Miami? What is the implied effect of self-driving cars?\nWe can visually answer both questions by plotting the actual revenue in Miami against the predicted one.\nplot_lines(df, treated_city, f'Synthetic {treated_city}', treatment_year)  It looks like self-driving cars had a sensible positive effect on revenue in Miami: the predicted trend is lower than the actual data and diverges right after the introduction of self-driving cars.\nOn the other hand, we are clearly overfitting: the pre-treatment predicted revenue line is perfectly overlapping with the actual data. Given the high variability of revenue in Miami, this is suspicious, to say the least.\nAnother problem concerns the weights. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot them.\ndf_states = pd.DataFrame({'city': [c for c in cities if c!=treated_city], 'ols_coef': coef}) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 9)) sns.barplot(data=df_states, x='ols_coef', y='city');  We have many negative weights, which do not make much sense from a causal inference perspective. I can understand that Miami can be expressed as a combination of 0.2 St. Louis, 0.15 Oklahoma and 0.15 Hartford. But what does it mean that Miami is -0.15 Milwaukee?\nSince we would like to interpret our synthetic control as a weighted average of untreated states, all weights should be positive and they should sum to one.\nTo address both concerns (weighting and overfitting), we need to impose some restrictions on the weights.\nExtensions Weights To solve the problems of overweighting and negative weights, Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller (2010) propose the following weights:\n$$ \\hat \\beta = \\arg \\min_{\\beta} || \\boldsymbol X_t - \\boldsymbol \\beta \\boldsymbol X_c || = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{p} \\left( X_{t, p} - \\sum_{i \\in c} \\beta_{p} X_{c, p} \\right)^2 } \\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad \\sum_{p} \\beta_p = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\beta_p \\geq 0 \\quad \\forall p $$\nWhich means, a set of weights $\\beta$ such that\n  weighted observable characteristics of the control group $X_c$, match the observable characteristics of the treatment group $X_t$, before the treatment\n  they sum to 1\n  and are not negative.\n  With this approach we get an interpretable counterfactual as a weighted avarage of untreated units.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s write now our own objective function. I create a new class SyntheticControl() which has both a loss function, as described above, a method to fit it and predict the values for the treated unit.\nfrom toolz import partial from scipy.optimize import fmin_slsqp class SyntheticControl(): # Loss function def loss(self, W, X, y) -\u0026gt; float: return np.sqrt(np.mean((y - X.dot(W))**2)) # Fit model def fit(self, X, y): w_start = [1/X.shape[1]]*X.shape[1] self.coef_ = fmin_slsqp(partial(self.loss, X=X, y=y), np.array(w_start), f_eqcons=lambda x: np.sum(x) - 1, bounds=[(0.0, 1.0)]*len(w_start), disp=False) self.mse = self.loss(W=self.coef_, X=X, y=y) return self # Predict def predict(self, X): return X.dot(self.coef_)  We can now repeat the same procedure as before, but using the SyntheticControl method instead of the simple, unconstrained LinearRegression.\ndf_states['coef_synth'] = synth_predict(df, SyntheticControl(), treated_city, treatment_year).coef_ plot_lines(df, treated_city, f'Synthetic {treated_city}', treatment_year)  As we can see, now we are not overfitting anymore. The actual and predicted revenue pre-treatment are close but not identical. The reason is that the non-negativity constraint is constraining most coefficients to be zero (as Lasso does).\nIt looks like the effect is again negative. However, let\u0026rsquo;s plot the difference between the two lines to better visualize the magnitude.\ndef plot_difference(df, city, year, vline=True, hline=True, **kwargs): sns.lineplot(x=df['year'], y=df[city] - df[f'Synthetic {city}'], **kwargs) if vline: plt.axvline(x=year, ls=\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;, color='C2', label='Self-driving cars', lw=3, zorder=100) plt.legend() if hline: sns.lineplot(x=df['year'], y=0, lw=3, color='k', zorder=1) plt.title(\u0026quot;Estimated effect of self-driving cars\u0026quot;);  plot_difference(df, treated_city, treatment_year)  The difference is clearly positive and slightly increasing over time.\nWe can also visualize the weights to interpret the estimated counterfactual (what would have happened in Miami, without self-driving cars).\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 9)) sns.barplot(data=df_states, x='coef_synth', y='city');  As we can see, now we are expressing revenue in Miami as a linear combination of just a couple of cities: Tampa, St. Louis and, to a lower extent, Las Vegas. This makes the whole procedure very transparent.\nInference What about inference? Is the estimate significantly different from zero? Or, more practically, \u0026ldquo;how unusual is this estimate under the null hypothesis of no policy effect?\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are going to perform a randomization/permutation test in order to answer this question. The idea is that if the policy has no effect, the effect we observe for Miami should not be significantly different from the effect we observe for any other city.\nTherefore, we are going to replicate the procedure above, but for all other cities and compare them with the estimate for Miami.\nfrom matplotlib.offsetbox import OffsetImage, AnnotationBbox fig, ax = plt.subplots() for city in cities: synth_predict(df, SyntheticControl(), city, treatment_year) plot_difference(df, city, treatment_year, vline=False, alpha=0.2, color='C1', lw=3) plot_difference(df, treated_city, treatment_year) ax.add_artist(AnnotationBbox(OffsetImage(plt.imread('fig/miami.png'), zoom=0.25), (2015, 2.7), frameon=False));  From the graph we notice two things. First, the effect for Miami is quite extreme and therefore likely not to be driven by random noise.\nSecond, we also notice that there are a couple of cities for which we cannot fit the pre-trend very well. In particular, there is a line that is sensibly lower than all others. This is expected since, for each city, we are building the counterfactual trend as a convex combination of all other cities. Cities that are quite extreme in terms of revenue are very useful to build the counterfactuals of other cities, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to build a counterfactual for them.\nNot to bias the analysis, let\u0026rsquo;s exclude states for which we cannot build a \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; counterfectual, in terms of pre-treatment MSE.\n$$ MSE_{pre} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t \\in \\text{pre}} \\left( Y_t - \\hat Y_t \\right)^2 $$\nAs a rule of thumb, Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller (2010) suggest to exclude units for which the prediction MSE is larger than twice the MSE of the treated unit.\n# Reference mse mse_treated = synth_predict(df, SyntheticControl(), treated_city, treatment_year).mse # Other mse fig, ax = plt.subplots() for city in cities: mse = synth_predict(df, SyntheticControl(), city, treatment_year).mse if mse \u0026lt; 2 * mse_treated: plot_difference(df, city, treatment_year, vline=False, alpha=0.2, color='C1', lw=3) plot_difference(df, treated_city, treatment_year) ax.add_artist(AnnotationBbox(OffsetImage(plt.imread('fig/miami.png'), zoom=0.25), (2015, 2.7), frameon=False));  After exluding extreme observations, it looks like the effect for Miami is very unusual.\nOne statistic that Abadie, Diamond and Hainmueller (2010) suggest to perform a randomization test is the ratio between pre-treatment MSE and post-treatment MSE.\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{MSE_{post}}{MSE_{pre}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t \\in \\text{post}} \\left( Y_t - \\hat Y_t \\right)^2 }{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{t \\in \\text{pre}} \\left( Y_t - \\hat Y_t \\right)^2 } $$\nWe can compute a p-value as the number of observations with higher ratio.\nlambdas = {} for city in cities: mse_pre = synth_predict(df, SyntheticControl(), city, treatment_year).mse mse_tot = np.mean((df[f'Synthetic {city}'] - df[city])**2) lambdas[city] = (mse_tot - mse_pre) / mse_pre print(f\u0026quot;p-value: {np.mean(np.fromiter(lambdas.values(), dtype='float') \u0026gt; lambdas[treated_city]):.4}\u0026quot;)  p-value: 0.04348  It seems that only $4.3%$ of the cities had a larger MSE ratio than Miami, implying a p-value of 0.043. We can visualize the distribution of the statistic under permutation with a histogram.\nfig, ax = plt.subplots() _, bins, _ = plt.hist(lambdas.values(), bins=20, color=\u0026quot;C1\u0026quot;); plt.hist([lambdas[treated_city]], bins=bins) plt.title('Ratio of $MSE_{post}$ and $MSE_{pre}$ across cities'); ax.add_artist(AnnotationBbox(OffsetImage(plt.imread('fig/miami.png'), zoom=0.25), (2.7, 1.7), frameon=False));  Indeed, the statistic for Miami is quite extreme.\nConclusion In this article, we have explored a very popoular method for causal inference when we have few treated units, but many time periods. This setting emerges often in industry settings when the treatment has to be assigned at the aggregate level and randomization might not be possible. The key idea of synthetic control is to combinate control units into one syntetic control unit to use as counterfactual to estimate the causal effect of the treatment.\nOne of the main advantages of synthetic control is that, as long as we use positive weights that are constrained to sum to one, the method avoids extrapolation: we will never go out of the support of the data. Moreover, synthetic control studies can be \u0026ldquo;pre-registered\u0026rdquo;: you can specify the weights before the study to avoid p-hacking and cherry picking. Another reason why this method is so popular in the industry is that weights make the counterfactual analysis explicit: one can look at the weights and understand which comparison we are making.\nThis method is relatively young and many extensions are appearing every year. Some notable ones are the generalyzed synthetic control by Xu (2017), the synthetic difference-in-differences by Doudchenko and Imbens (2017), the penalyzed synthetic control of Abadie e L\u0026rsquo;Hour (2020) and the matrix completion methods of Athey et al. (2021). Last but not least, if you want to have the method explained by one of its inventors, there is this great lecture by Alberto Abadie at the NBER Summer Institute freely available on Youtube.\n  References [1] A.

The testing of war materials is not only expensive but also destructive since, for example, bullets need to be fired in order to be tested.\nTherefore, the U.S. government was presented with the following dilemma: how many bullets should one fire out of a batch before declaring the batch reliable? Clearly, if we were to fire all the bullets, we would know the exact amount of functioning bullets in a crate. However, there would be no bullets left to use.\nBecause of the growing relevance of these statistical problems, in 1939, a group of prominent statisticians and economists joined forces at Columbia University\u0026rsquo;s Statistical Research Group (SGR). The group included, among others, W. Allen Wallis, Jacob Wolfowitz and Abraham Wald. According to Wallis himself the SGR group was \u0026ldquo;composed of what surely must be the most extraordinary group of statisticians ever organized, taking into account both number and quality\u0026quot;[2].\nTheir work was of first order importance and classified, to the point that Wallis reports:\n It is said that as Wald worked on sequential analysis his pages were snatched away and given a security classification. Being still an \u0026ldquo;enemy alien\u0026rdquo;, he did not have a security clearance so, the story has it, he was not allowed to know of his results. [Wallis (1980)]\n Indeed, the group worked under the pressure from the U.S. Army to deliver fast practical solutions that could be readily deployed on the field. For example, Wallis reports that\n during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, several high-ranking Army officers flew to Washington from the battle, spent a day discussing the best settings on proximity fuzes for air bursts of artillery shells against ground troops, and flew back to the battle to put into effect advice from, among others, Milton Friedman, whose earlier studies of the fuzes had given him extensive and accurate knowledge of the way the fuzes actually performed. [Wallis (1980)]\n The most prominent result that came out of the SGR experience was undoubtedly the Sequential Probability Ratio Test. The idea first came to Wallis and Friedman that realized that\n it might pay to use a test which would not be as efficient as the classical tests if a sample of exactly N were to be taken, but which would more than offset this disadvantage by providing a good chance of terminating early when used sequentially. [Wallis (1980)]\n The two economists exposed the idea to the statistician Jacob Wolfowitz who initially\n seemed to be something distasteful about the idea of people so ignorant of mathematics as Milton and I venturing to meddle with such sacred ideas as those of most powerful statistics, etc. No doubt this antipathy was strengthened by our calling the new tests \u0026ldquo;supercolossal\u0026rdquo; on the grounds that they are more powerful than \u0026ldquo;most powerful\u0026rdquo; tests. [Wallis (1980)]\n Ultimately, the two economists managed to draw the attention of both Wolfowitz and Wald that started to formally work on the idea. The results remained top secret until the end of the war when Wald published his Sequential Tests of Statistical Hypotheses article.\nIn this post, after a quick introduction to hypothesis testing, we are going to explore the Sequential Probability Ratio Test and implement it in Python.\nHypothesis Testing When we design an A/B test or, more generally, an experiment, the standard steps are the following\n  Define a null hypothesis $H_0$, usually a zero effect of the experiment on a metric of interest\n for example, no effect of a drug on mortality    Define a significance level $\\alpha$, usually equal to 0.05, it represents the maximum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true\n for example, the probability of claiming that the drug is effective in reducing mortality, when it\u0026rsquo;s not effective    Define an alternative hypothesis $H_1$, usually the minimum effect size that we would like to detect\n for example, a decrease in mortality by 1%    Define a power level $1-\\beta$, usually equal to 0.8 ($\\beta=0.2$), it represents the minimum probability of rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$, when the alternative $H_1$ is true\n for example, the probability of claiming that the drug is ineffective, when it\u0026rsquo;s effective    Pick a test statistic whose distribution is known under both hypotheses, usually the sample average of the metric of interest\n for example, the average mortality rate of patients    Compute the minimum sample size, in order to achieve the desired power level $1-\\beta$, given all the test parameters\n  Then, we run the test and, depending on the realized value of the test statistic, we decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or not. In particular, we reject the null hypothesis if the p-value, i.e. the probability of observing under the null hypothesis a statistic as or more extreme than the sample statistic, is lower than the significance level $\\alpha$.\nRemember that rejecting the null hypothesis does not imply accepting the alternative hypothesis.\nPeeking Suppose that halfway through the experiment we were to peek at the data and notice that, for that intermediate value of the test statistic, we would reject the null hypothesis. Should we stop the experiment? If we do, what happens?\nThe answer is that we should not stop the experiment. If we do, the test would not achieve the desired significance level or, in other terms, our confidence intervals would have the wrong coverage.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what I mean with an example. Suppose our data generating process is a standard normal distribution with unknown mean $\\mu$ and known variance $\\sigma=1$: $X \\sim N(\\mu,1)$.\nThe hypothesis that we wish to test is\n$$ \\begin{align} H_0: \\quad \u0026amp; \\mu = 0 \\newline H_1: \\quad \u0026amp; \\mu = 0.1 \\end{align} $$\nAfter each observation $n$, we compute the z test statistic\n$$ z = \\frac{\\bar X_n - \\mu_0}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} = \\frac{\\bar X_n - 0}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}} = \\bar X_n * \\sqrt{n} $$\nwhere $\\bar X_n$ is the sample mean from a sample $X_1, X_2, \u0026hellip;, X_n$, of size $n$, $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population, and $\\mu_0$ is the population mean, under the null hypothesis. The term in the denominator, $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, is the variance of the sample mean. Under the null hypothesis of zero mean, the test statistic is distributed as a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance, $N(0,1)$.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s code the test in Python. I import some code from utils to make the plots prettier.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * zstat = lambda x: np.mean(x) * np.sqrt(len(x)) zstat.__name__ = 'z-statistic'  Suppose we want a test with significance level $\\alpha=0.05$ and power $1-\\beta=0.8$. What sample size $n$ do we need?\nWe need a sample size such that\n The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$, when $H_0$ is true, is at most $\\alpha=0.05$ The probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$, when $H_0$ is false (i.e. $H_1$ is true), is at most $\\beta=0.2$  I.e. we need to find a critical value $c$ such that\n $c = \\mu_0 + z_{0.95} * \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ $c = \\mu_1 - z_{0.8} * \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$  where $z_{p}$ is the CDF inverse (or percent point function) at $p$, and $\\mu_i$ are the values of the mean under the different hypotheses.\nIf we do not know the sign of the unknown mean $\\mu$, we have to run a two-sided test. This means that the maximum probability of type 1 error on each side of the distribution has to be $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$, implying $z_{0.975} = 1.96$.\nCombining the two expressions together we can solve for the required minimum sample size.\n$$ n : \\mu_0 + z_{0.975} * \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\mu_1 - z_{0.8} * \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nso that\n$$ n = \\left( \\sigma * \\frac{z_{0.975} + z_{0.8}}{\\mu_0 + \\mu_1} \\right)^2 = \\left( 1 * \\frac{1.96 + 0.84}{0 + 0.1} \\right)^2 = 784.89 $$\nfrom scipy.stats import norm n = ( (norm.ppf(0.975) + norm.ppf(0.8)) / 0.1 )**2 print(f\u0026quot;Minimum sample size: {n}\u0026quot;)  Minimum sample size: 784.8879734349086  We need at least 785 observations.\nWe can get a better intuition by graphically plotting the two distributions with the critical value. I wrote a function plot_test to draw a standard hypothesis testing setting.\nfrom src.figures import plot_test plot_test(mu0=0, mu1=0.1, alpha=0.05, n=n)  The critical value is such that, given the distributions under the two hypothesis, the rejection area in red is equal to $\\alpha$. The sample size $n$ is such that it shrinks the variance of the two distributions so that the area in green is equal to $\\beta$.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now simulate an experiment in which we draw an ordered sequence of observations and, after each observation, we compute the value of the test statistic.\ndef experiment(f_stat, mu=0, n=785, seed=1): np.random.seed(seed) # Set seed I = np.arange(1, n+1) # Observation index x = np.random.normal(mu, 1, n) # Observation value stat = [f_stat(x[:i]) for i in I] # Value of the test statistic so far df = pd.DataFrame({'i': I, 'x': x, f_stat.__name__: stat}) # Generate dataframe return df  Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at what a sample looks like.\ndf = experiment(zstat) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  i x z-statistic     0 1 1.624345 1.624345   1 2 -0.611756 0.716009   2 3 -0.528172 0.279678   3 4 -1.072969 -0.294276   4 5 0.865408 0.123814     We can now plot the time trend of the test statistic as we accumulate observations during the sampling process. I also mark with horizontal lines the values for rejection of the null hypothesis of a test with $\\alpha = 0.05$: $z_{0.025} = -1.96$ and $z_{0.975} = 1.96$.\ndef plot_experiment(df, ybounds, **kwargs): sns.lineplot(data=df, x='i', y=df.columns[2], **kwargs) for ybound in ybounds: sns.lineplot(x=df['i'], y=ybound, lw=1.5, color='black') plt.title(f'{df.columns[2]} with sequential sampling') plt.yticks([0, ybounds[0], ybounds[1]])  plot_experiment(df, ybounds=[-1.96, 1.96])  In this case, the test never crosses the critical values. Therefore, peeking does not have an effect. We would not have stopped the experiment prematurely.\nWhat would happen if we were repeating the experiment many times? Since the data is generated under the null hypothesis, $H_0: \\mu = 0$, we expect to reject it only $\\alpha=5%$ of the times.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s simulate the data-generating process $K=100$ times.\ndef simulate_experiments(f_stat, ybounds, xmin=0, early_stop=False, mu=0, K=100, n=785, **kwargs): # Count experiment durations stops = np.zeros(K) * n # Perform K simulations for k in range(K): # Draw data df = experiment(f_stat, mu=mu, seed=k, n=n) vals = df[f_stat.__name__].values # If early stop, check early violations (during sampling) if early_stop: violations = (vals[xmin:] \u0026gt; max(ybounds)) + (vals[xmin:] \u0026lt; min(ybounds)) if early_stop and any(violations): end = 1 + xmin + np.where(violations)[0][0] plot_experiment(df.iloc[:end, :], ybounds, **kwargs) stops[k] = end * np.sign(df[f_stat.__name__].values[end]) # Otherwise, only check violations of last value elif (vals[-1] \u0026gt; max(ybounds)) or (vals[-1] \u0026lt; min(ybounds)): plot_experiment(df, ybounds, **kwargs) stops[k] = len(df) * np.sign(vals[-1]) # Plot all other observations in grey else: plot_experiment(df, ybounds, color='grey', alpha=0.1, lw=1) # Print diagnostics pct_up = sum(stops\u0026gt;0)/sum(stops!=0)*100 print(f'Bounds crossed: {sum(stops!=0)} ({pct_up:.0f}% upper, {100-pct_up:.0f}% lower)') print(f'Average experiment duration: {(sum(np.abs(stops)) + n*sum(stops==0))/ len(stops) :.0f}')  We plot the distribution of the z-statistic over samples .\nsimulate_experiments(zstat, ybounds=[-1.96, 1.96], early_stop=False);  Bounds crossed: 3 (67% upper, 33% lower) Average experiment duration: 785  In the figure above, I have highlighted the experiments for which we reject the null hypothesis without peeking, i.e. given the value of the z test statistic at the end of the sampling process. Only in 3 experiments the final value lies outside the critical values, so that we reject the null hypothesis. This means a rejection rate of 3% which is very close to the expected rejection rate of $\\alpha=0.05$ (under the null).\nWhat if instead we were impatient and, after collecting the first 100 observations, we were stopping as soon as we saw the z-statistic crossing the boundaries?\nstops_zstat_h0 = simulate_experiments(zstat, xmin=99, ybounds=[-1.96, 1.96], early_stop=True, lw=2); plt.vlines(100, ymin=plt.ylim()[0], ymax=plt.ylim()[1], color='k', lw=1, ls='--');  Bounds crossed: 29 (45% upper, 55% lower) Average experiment duration: 644  In the figure above, I have highlighted the experiments in which the values of the z-statistic crosses one of the boundaries, from the 100th observation onwards. This happens in 29 simulations out of 100, which implies a rejection rate of 25%, which is very far from the expected rejection rate of $\\alpha=0.05$ (under the null hypothesis). Peaking distorts the significance level of the test.\nPotential solutions are:\n sequential probability ratio tests sequential triangular testing group sequential testing  Before analyzing these sequential testing procedures, we first need to introduce the likelihood ratio test.\nLikelihood Ratio Test The likelihood ratio test is a test that tries to assess the likelihood that the observed data was generated by either one of two competing statistical models. In order to perform the likelihood ratio test for hypothesis testing, we need the data generating process to be fully specified under both hypotheses. For example, this would be the case with the following hypotheses:\n$$ \\begin{align} H_0: \\quad \u0026amp; \\mu=0 \\newline H_1: \\quad \u0026amp; \\mu=0.1 \\end{align} $$\nIn this case, we say that the statistical test is fully specified. If the alternative hypothesis was $H_1: \\mu \\neq 0$, then the data generating process would not be specified under the alternative hypothesis. When a statistical test is fully specified, we can compute the likelihood ratio as the the ratio of the likelihood function under the two hypotheses.\n$$ \\Lambda (X) = \\frac{\\mathcal L (\\theta_1 \\ | \\ X)}{\\mathcal L (\\theta_0 \\ | \\ X)} $$\nThe likelihood-ratio test provides a decision rule as follows:\n If $\\Lambda\u0026gt;c$, reject $H_{0}$; If $\\Lambda\u0026lt;c$, do not reject $H_{0}$; If $\\Lambda =c$, reject with probability $q$  The values $c$ and $q$ are usually chosen to obtain a specified significance level $\\alpha$.\nThe Neyman–Pearson lemma states that this likelihood-ratio test is the most powerful among all level $\\alpha$ tests for this case.\nSpecial Case: testing mean of normal distribution Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our example where data is coming from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\\mu$ and known variance $\\sigma^2$ and we want to perform the following test\n$$ \\begin{align} H_0: \\quad \u0026amp; \\mu = 0 , \\newline H_1: \\quad \u0026amp; \\mu = 0.1 \\end{align} $$\nThe likelihood of the normal distribution with unknown mean $\\mu$ and known variance $\\sigma^2$ is\n$$ \\mathcal L(\\mu) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi} \\sigma } \\right)^n e^{- \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}} $$\nSo that the likelihood ratio under the two hypotheses is\n$$ \\Lambda(X) = \\frac{\\mathcal L (0.1, \\sigma^2)}{\\mathcal L (0, \\sigma^2)} = \\frac{e^{- \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i - 0.1)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}}{e^{- \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}} $$\nWe now have all the ingredients to move on to the final purpose of this blog post: the Sequential Probability Ratio Test.\nSequential Probability Ratio Test Given a pair of fully specified hypotheses, say $H_{0}$ and $H_{1}$, the first step of the sequential probability ratio test is to calculate the log-likelihood ratio test $\\log (\\Lambda_{i})$, as new data arrive: with $S_{0}=0$, then, for $i=1,2,\u0026hellip;,$\n$$ S_{i} = S_{i-1} + \\log(\\Lambda_{i}) $$\nThe stopping rule is a simple thresholding scheme:\n $S_{i}\\geq b$: Accept $H_{1}$ $S_{i}\\leq a$: Accept $H_{0}$ $a\u0026lt;S_{i}\u0026lt;b$: continue monitoring (critical inequality)  where $a$ and $b$ ($-\\infty\u0026lt;a\u0026lt;0\u0026lt;b\u0026lt;\\infty$) depend on the desired type I and type II errors, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\nWald (1945) shows that the choice of the following boundaries delivers a test with expected probability of type 1 and 2 error not greater than $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively.\n$$ a \\approx \\log {\\frac {\\beta }{1-\\alpha }} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b \\approx \\log {\\frac {1-\\beta }{\\alpha }} $$\nThe equations are approximations because of the discrete nature of the data generating process.\nWald and Wolfowitz (1948) have proven that a test with these boundaries is the most powerful sequential probability ratio test, i.e. all SPR tests with the same power and significance require at least the same amount of observations.\nSpecial Case: testing null effect Let\u0026rsquo;s go back to our example where data is coming from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\\mu$ and known variance $\\sigma^2$ and hypotheses $H_0: \\ \\mu = 0$ and $H_1: \\ \\mu = 0.1$.\nWe have seen that the likelihood ratio with a sample of size $n$ is\n$$ \\Lambda(X) = \\frac{\\mathcal L (0.1, \\sigma^2)}{\\mathcal L (0, \\sigma^2)} = \\frac{e^{- \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i - 0.1)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}}{e^{- \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}} $$\nTherefore, the log-likelihood (easier to compute) is\n$$ \\log (\\Lambda(X)) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i)^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(X_i - 0.1)^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right) $$\nSimulation We are now ready to perform some simulations. First, let\u0026rsquo;s code the log likelihood ratio test statistic that we have just computed.\nlog_lr = lambda x: (np.sum((x)**2) - np.sum((x-0.1)**2) ) / 2 log_lr.__name__ = 'log likelihood-ratio'  We now repeat the same experiment we did at the beginning, with one difference: we will compute the log likelihood ratio as a statistic. The data generating process has $\\mu=0$, as under the null hypothesis.\ndf = experiment(log_lr, ) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  i x log likelihood-ratio     0 1 1.624345 0.157435   1 2 -0.611756 0.091259   2 3 -0.528172 0.033442   3 4 -1.072969 -0.078855   4 5 0.865408 0.002686     Let\u0026rsquo;s now compute the optimal bounds, given significance level $\\alpha=0.05$ and power $1-\\beta=0.8$.\nalpha = 0.05 beta = 0.2 a = np.log( beta / (1-alpha) ) b = np.log( (1-beta) / alpha ) print(f'Optimal bounds : [{a:.3f}, {b:.3f}]')  Optimal bounds : [-1.558, 2.773]  Since significance and (one minus) power are different, the bound for the null hypothesis is much closer than the bound for the alternative hypothesis. This means that, in case of an intermediate effect of $\\mu=0.05$, we will be more likely to accept the null hypothesis $H_0: \\mu = 0$ than the alternative $H_1: \\mu = 0.1$.\nWe can plot the distribution of the likelihood ratio over samples drawn under the null hypothesis $H_0: \\mu = 0$.\nplot_experiment(df, ybounds=[a,b])  In this particular case, the test is inconclusive within our sampling framework. We need to collect more data in order to come to a decision.\nplot_experiment(experiment(log_lr, n=789), ybounds=[a,b]);  It takes 789 observations to reach to a conclusion, while before the sample size was 785. This test procedure can require a larger sample size than the previous one. Is it true on average?\nWhat would happen if we were to repeat the experiment $K=100$ times?\nsimulate_experiments(log_lr, ybounds=[a, b], early_stop=True, lw=1.5);  Bounds crossed: 96 (4% upper, 96% lower) Average experiment duration: 264  We get a decision for 96 simulations out of 100 and for 96% of them, it\u0026rsquo;s the correct decision. Therefore, our rejection rate is very close to the expected $\\alpha=0.05$ (under the null hypothesis).\nHowever, for 4 experiments, the test is inconclusive. What would happen if we were to sample until we reach a conclusion in each experiment?\nsimulate_experiments(log_lr, ybounds=[a,b], early_stop=True, lw=1.5, n=1900);  Bounds crossed: 100 (4% upper, 96% lower) Average experiment duration: 275  As we can see from the plot, in one particularly unlucky experiment, we need to collect 1900 observations before coming to a conclusion. However, despite this outlier, the average experiment duration is an astounding 275 samples, almost a third of the original sample size of 785.\nWhat would happen if instead the alternative hypothesis $H_1: \\mu = 0.1$ was true?\nsimulate_experiments(log_lr, ybounds=[a,b], early_stop=True, mu=0.1, lw=1, n=2100);  Bounds crossed: 100 (84% upper, 16% lower) Average experiment duration: 443  In this case, we make the correct decision in only 84% of the simulations, which is very close to the expected value of 80% (under the alternative hypothesis), i.e. the power of the experiment, 1-β.\nMoreover, also under the alternative hypothesis we need a significantly lower sample size: just 443 observation, on average.h a conclusion in 78/100 experiments we need just 1/3 of the samples!\nConclusion In this post, we have seen the dangers of peeking during a randomized experiment. Prematurely stopping a test can be dangerous since it distorts inference, biasing the expected rejection rates.\nDoes it mean that we always need to perform tests with a pre-specified sample size? No! There exist procedures that allow for optimal stopping. These procedures were born for a specific purpose: reducing the sample size as much as possible, without sacrificing accuracy. The first and most known is the Sequential Probability Ratio Test, defined by Wallis as \u0026ldquo;the most powerful and seminal statistical ideas of the past third of a century\u0026rdquo; (in 1980).\nThe SPRT was not only a powerful tool during war time but keeps being used today for very practical purposes (see for example Netflix, Uber).\nReferences [1] A.

By randomly exposing units to a treatment we make sure that individuals in both groups are comparable, on average, and any difference we observe can be attributed to the treatment effect alone.\nHowever, often the treatment and control groups are not perfectly comparable. This could be due to the fact that randomization was not perfect or available. Not always we can randomize a treatment, for ethical or practical reasons. And even when we can, sometimes we do not have enough individuals or units so that differences between groups are seizable. This happens often, for example, when randomization is not done at the individual level, but at a higher level of aggregation, for example zipcodes, counties or even states.\nIn a previous post, I have introduced and compared a series of methods that compute conditional average treatment effects (CATE) from observational or experimental data. Some of these methods require the researcher to specify and estimate the distribution of the outcome of interest, given the treatment and the observable characteristics (e.g. meta learners). Other methods require the researcher to specify and estimate the probability of being treated, given the observable characteristics (e.g. IPW).\nIn this post, we are going to see a procedure that combines both methods and is robust to misspecification of either method\u0026rsquo;s model: the Augmented Inverse Probability Weighted estimator (AIPW).\nTLDR; AIPW greatly improves both IPW and meta-learners, and you should always use it!\nExample Assume we had blog on statistics and causal inference 😇. To improve user experience, we are considering releasing a dark mode, and we would like to understand whether this new feature increases the time users spend on our blog.\nThis example is borrowed from my last post on the estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE). You can find the original post here. If you remember the setting, you can skip this introduction.\nWe are not a sophisticated company, therefore we do not run an AB test but we simply release the dark mode and we observe whether users select it or not and the time they spend on the blog. We know that there might be selection: users that prefer the dark mode could have different reading preferences and this might complicate our causal analysis.\nWe can represent the data generating process with the following Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\nflowchart TB classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; X1((gender)) X2((age)) X3((hours)) D((dark mode)) Y((read time)) D --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; D X2 --\u0026gt; D X3 --\u0026gt; Y class D,Y included; class X1,X2,X3 excluded;  We generate the simulated data using the data generating process dgp_darkmode() from src.dgp.

As a first approach, we might naively compute the effect as a difference in means, assuming that the treatment and control sample are comparable. We can estimate the difference in means by regressing read_time on dark_mode.\nsmf.ols(\u0026quot;read_time ~ dark_mode\u0026quot;, data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  19.1748  0.402  47.661  0.000  18.383  19.967   dark_mode[T.True]  -0.4446  0.571  -0.779  0.437  -1.568  0.679   Individuals that select the dark_mode spend on average 0.44 hours less on the blog, per week. Should we conclude that dark_mode is a bad idea? Is this a causal effect?\nThe problem is that we did not run an AB test or randomized control trial, therefore users that selected the dark_mode might not be directly comparable with users that didn\u0026rsquo;t. Can we verify this concern? Partially. We can only check characteristics that we observe, gender, age and total hours in our setting. We cannot check if users differ along other dimensions that we don\u0026rsquo;t observe.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use the create_table_one function from Uber\u0026rsquo;s causalml package to produce a covariate balance table, containing the average value of our observable characteristics, across treatment and control groups.

In particular, users that select the dark_mode are older, have spent less hours on the blog and they are more likely to be males.\nWhat can we do? If we assume that all differences between treatment and control group are observable, we can solve the problem by performing conditional analysis.\nConditional Analysis We assume that for a set of subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ we observed a set of variables $(D_i, Y_i, X_i)$ that includes\n a treatment assignment $D_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ (dark_mode) a response $Y_i \\in \\mathbb R$ (read_time) a feature vector $X_i \\in \\mathbb R^n$ (gender, age and hours)  We are interested in estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE).\n$$ \\tau(x) = \\mathbb E \\Big[ Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)} \\ \\Big| \\ X_i = x \\Big] $$\nWhere $Y_i^{(d)}$ indicates the potential outcome of individual $i$ under treatment status $d$. We also make the following assumptions.\nAssumption 1 : unconfoundedness (or ignorability, or selection on observables)\n$$ \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ X_i $$\ni.e. conditional on observable characteristics $X$, the treatment assignment $D$ is as good as random. What we are effectively assuming is that there is no other characteristics that we do not observe that could impact both whether a user selects the dark_mode and their read_time. This is a strong assumption that is more likely to be satisfied the more individual characteristics we observe.\nAssumption 2: overlap (or common support)\n$$ \\exists \\eta \u0026gt; 0 \\ : \\ \\eta \\leq \\mathbb E \\left[ D_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right] \\leq 1-\\eta $$\ni.e. no observation is deterministically assigned to the treatment or control group. This is a more technical assumption that basically means that for any level of gender, age or hours, there could exist an individual that select the dark_mode and one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Differently from the unconfoundedness assumption, the overal assumption is testable.\nAssumption 3: stable unit treatment value (SUTVA)\n$$ Y^{(d)} \\perp D $$\ni.e. the potential outcome does not depend on the treatment status. In our case, we are ruling out the fact that another user selecting dark_mode might affect my effect of dark_mode on read_time. The most common setting where SUTVA is violated is in presence of network effects: if a friend of mine uses a social network increases my utility from using it.\nIPW and Meta-Learners Two alternative ways to perform conditional analysis are\n IPW: balance observations by their conditional treatment assignment probability and then estimate the treatment effect as a weighted difference in means Meta Learners: predict the potential outcomes from observable characteristics and estimate treatment effects as the difference between observed and counterfactual outcomes  These two alternative procedures exploit the fact that we observe individual characteristics $X$ in different ways:\n IPW exploits $X$ to predict the treatment assignment $D$ and estimate the propensity scores $e(X) = \\mathbb{E} [D | X]$ Meta Learners exploit $X$ to predict the counterfactual outcomes $Y^{(d)}$ and estimate the response function $\\mu(X)^{(d)} = \\mathbb{E} [Y | D, X]$  Can we combine the two procedures and get the best of both worlds?\nYes, with the AIPW or double-robust estimator.\nThe AIPW Estimator The Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted estimator is given by\n$$ \\hat \\tau_{AIPW} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) + \\frac{D_i }{\\hat e(X_i)} \\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) \\right) - \\frac{(1-D_i) }{1-\\hat e(X_i)} \\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) \\right) \\right) $$\nwhere $\\mu^{(d)}(x)$ is the response function, i.e. the expected value of the outcome, conditional on observable characteristics $x$ and treatment status $d$, and $e(X)$ is the propensity score.\n$$ \\mu^{(d)}(x) = \\mathbb E \\left[ Y_i \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x, D_i = d \\right] \\qquad ; \\qquad e(x) = \\mathbb E \\left[ D_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right] $$\nThe formula of the AIPW estimator seems very cryptic at first, so let\u0026rsquo;s dig deeper and try to understand it.\nDecomposition The best way to understand the AIPW formula is to decompose it into two parts.\nThe first way is to decompose the AIPW estimator into a S-learner estimator and an adjustment factor.\n$$ \\hat \\tau_{AIPW} = \\hat \\tau_{S-learn} + \\widehat{\\text{adj}}_{S-learn} $$\nwhere\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat \\tau_{S-learn} =\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) \\right) \\newline \\widehat {adj} _ {S-learn} =\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{D_i }{\\hat e(X_i)} \\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) \\right) - \\frac{(1-D_i) }{1-\\hat e(X_i)} \\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) \\right) \\right) \\end{aligned} $$\nThe adjustment is essentially an IPW estimator performed on the residuals of the S-learner.\nThe second way to decompose the AIPW estimator into the IPW estimator and an adjustment factor.\n$$ \\hat \\tau_{AIPW} = \\hat \\tau_{IPW} + \\widehat{\\text{adj}}_{IPW} $$\nwhere\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat \\tau_{IPW} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{D_i Y_i}{\\hat e(X_i)} - \\frac{(1-D_i) Y_i}{1-\\hat e(X_i)} \\right) \\newline \\widehat {adj} _ {IPW} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\hat e(X_i) - D_i}{\\hat e(X_i)} \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) - \\frac{(1-\\hat e(X_i)) - (1-D_i)}{1-\\hat e(X_i)} \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) \\right) \\end{aligned} $$\nThe adjustment is essentially an S-learner estimator weighted by the residual treatment probabilities.\nDouble Robustness Why is the AIPW estimator so compelling? The reason is that it just needs one of the two predictions, $\\hat \\mu$ or $\\hat e$, to be right in order to be unbiased (i.e. correct on average). Let\u0026rsquo;s check it.\nIf $\\hat \\mu$ is correctly specified, i.e. $\\mathbb E \\left[ \\hat \\mu^{(d)}(x) \\right] = \\mathbb E \\left[ Y_i \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x, D_i = d \\right]$, then $\\hat \\tau_{AIPW}$ is unbiased, even if $\\hat e$ is misspecified.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat \\tau_{AIPW} \u0026amp;\\overset{p}{\\to} \\mathbb E \\Big[ \\hat \\tau_{S-learn} + \\widehat{\\text{adj}}_{S-learn} \\Big] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\mathbb E \\left[ \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) + \\frac{D_i \\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) \\right)}{\\hat e(X_i)} - \\frac{(1-D_i) \\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) \\right)}{1-\\hat e(X_i)} \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\mathbb E \\left[ \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\mathbb E \\left[ Y^{(1)} - Y^{(0)} \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\tau \\end{aligned} $$\nThe intuition is that, if $\\hat \\mu$ is correctly specified, $\\hat \\tau_{S-learn}$ is unbiased and the adjustment factor vanishes, since the residuals $\\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(t)}(X_i) \\right)$ converge to zero.\nOn the other hand, if $\\hat e$ is correctly specified, i.e. $\\mathbb E \\left[\\hat e(x) \\right] = \\mathbb E \\left[ D_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right]$, then $\\hat \\tau_{AIPW}$ is unbiased, even if $\\hat \\mu$ is misspecified.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\hat \\tau_{AIPW} \u0026amp; \\overset{p}{\\to} \\mathbb E \\Big[ \\hat \\tau_{IPW} + \\widehat{\\text{adj}}_{IPW} \\Big] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\mathbb E \\left[ \\frac{D_i Y_i}{\\hat e(X_i)} - \\frac{(1-D_i) Y_i }{1-\\hat e(X_i)} + \\frac{\\hat e(X_i) - D_i}{\\hat e(X_i)} \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) - \\frac{(1-\\hat e(X_i)) - (1-D_i)}{1-\\hat e(X_i)} \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\mathbb E \\left[ \\frac{D_i Y_i}{\\hat e(X_i)} - \\frac{(1-D_i) Y_i }{1-\\hat e(X_i)}\\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\mathbb E \\left[ Y^{(1)} - Y^{(0)} \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\tau \\end{aligned} $$\nThe intuition is that, if $\\hat e$ is correctly specified, $\\hat \\tau_{IPW}$ is unbiased and the adjustment factor vanishes, since the residuals $\\left( D_i - \\hat e (X_i) \\right)$ converge to zero.\nBest Practices 1. Check Covariate Balance\nBoth IPW and AIPW were built for settings in which the treatment $D$ is not unconditionally randomly assigned, but might depend on some observables $X$. This information can be checked in two ways:\n Produce a balance table, summarizing the covariates across treatment arms. If unconditional randomization does not hold, we expect to see significant differences across some observables Plot the estimated propensity scores. If unconditional randomization holds, we expect the propensity scores to be constant  2. Check the Overlap Assumption\nAnother assumption that we can check is the overlap assumption, i.e. $\\exists \\eta \\ : \\ \\eta \\leq \\mathbb E \\left[ D_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right] \\leq 1-\\eta$. To check this assumption we can simply check the bounds of the predicted propensity scores. If the overlap assumption is violated, we end up dividing some term of the estimator by zero.\n3. Use Cross-Fitting\nWhenever we build a prediction, it is best practice to exclude observation $i$ when estimating $\\hat \\mu^{(d)} (X_i)$ or $\\hat e (X_i)$. This procedure is generally known as cross-fitting in the machine learning literature. While there are many possible ways to perform cross-fitting, the simplest one is the following:\n Split the sample in two at random Use sample 1 to estimate $\\hat \\mu^{(d)} (X_i)$ and $\\hat e (X_i)$ Use sample 2 to estimate $\\hat{\\tau}_{AIPW, 1}$ Repeat (2) and (3) swapping samples to estimate $\\hat{\\tau}_{AIPW, 2}$ Compute $\\hat{\\tau}_{AIPW}$ as the average of the two estimates  Steps (2) and (3) ensure that the estimator is not overfitting. Steps (4) and (5) ensure that the estimator is efficient, using all the data for all steps and not just half. Kennedy (2022) shows that this procedure produces much more precise estimates than existing methods and provide formal results on error bounds. In particular, their main result is the following:\n \u0026ldquo;The bound on the DR-Learner error given in Theorem 2 shows that it can only deviate from the oracle error by at most a (smoothed) product of errors in the propensity score and regression estimators, thus allowing faster rates for estimating the CATE even when the nui- sance estimates converge at slower rates. Importantly the result is agnostic about the methods used, and requires no special tuning or undersmoothing.\u0026rdquo;\n Back to the Data Let\u0026rsquo;s now build and explore the AIPW estimator in our dataset on blog reading time and dark mode.\nPropensity Scores First, let\u0026rsquo;s estimate the propensity scores $e(X)$.\ndef estimate_e(df, X, D, model_e): e = model_e.fit(df[X], df[D]).predict_proba(df[X])[:,1] return e  We estimate them by logistic regression using the LogisticRegression methods from the sklearn package.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression df['e'] = estimate_e(df, X, \u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;, LogisticRegression())  Let\u0026rsquo;s check if the bounded support assumption is satisfied, by plotting the estimated propensity scores, across treatment and control groups.\nsns.histplot(data=df, x='e', hue='dark_mode', bins=30, stat='density', common_norm=False).\\ set(ylabel=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, title=\u0026quot;Distribution of Propensity Scores\u0026quot;);  The distribution of propensity scores is different between two groups, but it\u0026rsquo;s generally overlapping.\nWe can now use the propensity scores to build the IPW estimator.\nw = 1 / (e * df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;] + (1-e) * (1-df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;])) smf.wls(\u0026quot;read_time ~ dark_mode\u0026quot;, weights=w, data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  18.6099  0.412  45.159  0.000  17.799  19.421   dark_mode[T.True]  1.0620  0.582  1.826  0.069  -0.083  2.207   Note that the computed standard errors are not exact, since we are ignoring the extra uncertainty that comes from the estimation of the propensity scores $e(X)$.\nResponse Function Let\u0026rsquo;s now estimate the second building block of the AIPW estimator: the response function $\\mu(X)$.\ndef estimate_mu(df, X, D, y, model_mu): mu = model_mu.fit(df[X + [D]], df[y]) mu0 = mu.predict(df[X + [D]].assign(dark_mode=0)) mu1 = mu.predict(df[X + [D]].assign(dark_mode=1)) return mu0, mu1  Let\u0026rsquo;s start by estimating $\\mu(X)$ with linear regression.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression mu0, mu1 = estimate_mu(df, X, \u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;read_time\u0026quot;, LinearRegression()) print(np.mean(mu1-mu0))  1.3858099131476969  We have computed the meta learner estimate of the average treatment effect as the difference in means between the two estimated response functions, $\\mu^{(1)}(X)$ and $\\mu^{(0)}(X)$.\nNote that we can use any estimator to get the response function, I used linear regression for simplicity.\nEstimating AIPW We now have all the building blocks to compute the AIPW estimator!\naipw = mu1 - mu0 + df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;] / e * (df[\u0026quot;read_time\u0026quot;] - mu1) - (1-df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;]) / (1-e) * (df[\u0026quot;read_time\u0026quot;] - mu0) print(np.mean(aipw))  1.3153774511905783  We can also compute it directly using the LinearDRLearner function from Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s EconML library.\nfrom econml.drlearner import LinearDRLearner model = LinearDRLearner(model_propensity=LogisticRegression(), model_regression=LinearRegression(), random_state=1) model.fit(Y=df[\u0026quot;read_time\u0026quot;], T=df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;], X=df[X]);  The model directly gives us the average treatment effect.\nmodel.ate_inference(X=df[X].values, T0=0, T1=1).summary().tables[0]  Uncertainty of Mean Point Estimate  mean_point stderr_mean zstat pvalue ci_mean_lower ci_mean_upper   1.417 0.541 2.621 0.009 0.358 2.477   The estimate is statistically different from zero and the confidence interval includes the true value of 2.\nNote that we got a different estimate because the LinearDRLearner function also performed cross-fitting in the background, which we did not before.\nAssessment Let\u0026rsquo;s now assess the main property of the AIPW estimator: its double robustness. To do so, we compare it with its two parents: the IPW estimator and the S-learner.\ndef compare_estimators(X_e, X_mu, D, y, seed): df = dgp_darkmode().generate_data(seed=seed) e = estimate_e(df, X_e, D, LogisticRegression()) mu0, mu1 = estimate_mu(df, X_mu, D, y, LinearRegression()) slearn = mu1 - mu0 ipw = (df[D] / e - (1-df[D]) / (1-e)) * df[y] aipw = slearn + df[D] / e * (df[y] - mu1) - (1-df[D]) / (1-e) * (df[y] - mu0) return np.mean((slearn, ipw, aipw), axis=1)  We use the joblib library to run the simulations in parallel and speed up the process.\nfrom joblib import Parallel, delayed def simulate_estimators(X_e, X_mu, D, y): r = Parallel(n_jobs=8)(delayed(compare_estimators)(X_e, X_mu, D, y, i) for i in range(100)) df_tau = pd.DataFrame(r, columns=['S-learn', 'IPW', 'AIPW']) plot = sns.boxplot(data=pd.melt(df_tau), x='variable', y='value', linewidth=2); plot.set(title=\u0026quot;Distribution of $\\hat τ$ and its components\u0026quot;, xlabel='', ylabel='') plot.axhline(2, c='r', ls=':');  First, let\u0026rsquo;s assume that we use all variables for both models, $\\mu(X)$ and $e(X)$. In this case, both models are well specified and we expect all estimators to perform well.\nWe plot the distribution of the three estimators across 100 simulations.\nsimulate_estimators(X_e=X, X_mu=X, D=\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;read_time\u0026quot;)  Indeed, all estimator are unbiased and deliver very similar estimates.\nWhat happens if we misspecify one of the two models? Let\u0026rsquo;s start by (correctly) assuming that gender and age influence the probability of selecting dark_mode and (wrongly) assuming that only previous hours influence the weekly read_time. In this case, the propensity score $e(X)$ is well specified, while the response function $\\mu(X)$ is misspecified.\nsimulate_estimators(X_e=['male', 'age'], X_mu=['hours'], D=\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;read_time\u0026quot;)  As expected, the S-learner is biased since we have misspecified $\\mu(X)$, while IPW isn\u0026rsquo;t. AIPW picks the best of both worlds and is unbiased.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now explore the alternative misspecification. We (wrongly) assume that only age influences the probability of selecting dark_mode and (correctly) assume that both gender and previous hours influence the weekly read_time. In this case, the propensity score $e(X)$ is misspecified, while the response function $\\mu(X)$ is correctly specified.\nsimulate_estimators(['age'], ['male', 'hours'], D=\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;read_time\u0026quot;)  In this case, the S-learner is unbiased, while IPW isn\u0026rsquo;t, since we have misspecified $e(X)$. Again, AIPW picks the best of both worlds and is unbiased.\nConclusion In this article we have seen a method to estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATE), that is robust to model misspecification: the Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighted (AIPW) estimator. The AIPW estimator takes the best out of two existing estimators: the IPW estimator and the S-learner. It requires the estimation of both the propensity score function $\\mathbb{E} [ D | X ]$ and the response function $\\mathbb{E} [ Y | D, X ]$ and it is unbiased even if one of the two functions is misspecified.\nThis estimator is now a standard and it is included all the most important causal inference packages such as Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s EconML, Uber\u0026rsquo;s causalml and Stanford researchers' R package grf.\nReferences [1] J.

By randomly exposing units to a treatment we make sure that individuals in both groups are comparable, on average, and any difference we observe can be attributed to the treatment effect alone.\nHowever, often the treatment and control groups are not perfectly comparable. This could be due to the fact that randomization was not perfect or available. Not always we can randomize a treatment, for ethical or practical reasons. And even when we can, sometimes we do not have enough individuals or units so that differences between groups are seizable. This happens often, for example, when randomization is not done at the individual level, but at a higher level of aggregation, for example zipcodes, counties or even states.\nIn these settings, we can still recover a causal estimate of the treatment effect if we have enough information about individuals, by making the treatment and control group comparable, ex-post. In this blog post, we are going to introduce and compare different procedures to estimate causal effects in presence of imbalances between treatment and control groups that are fully observable. In particular we are going to analyze weighting, matching and regression procedures.\nExample Assume we had blog on statistics and causal inference 😇. To improve user experience, we are considering releasing a dark mode, and we would like to understand whether this new feature increases the time users spend on our blog.\nWe are not a sophisticated company, therefore we do not run an AB test but we simply release the dark mode and we observe whether users select it or not and the time they spend on the blog. We know that there might be selection: users that prefer the dark mode could have different reading preferences and this might complicate our causal analysis.\nWe can represent the data generating process with the following Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\nflowchart TB classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; X1((gender)) X2((age)) X3((hours)) D((dark mode)) Y((read time)) D --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; D X2 --\u0026gt; D X3 --\u0026gt; Y class D,Y included; class X1,X2,X3 excluded;  We generate the simulated data using the data generating process dgp_darkmode() from src.dgp.

If we were runnig an AB test or randomized control trial, we could just compare users with and without the dark mode and we could attribute the difference in average reading time to the dark_mode. Let\u0026rsquo;s check what number we would get.\nnp.mean(df.loc[df.dark_mode==True, 'read_time']) - np.mean(df.loc[df.dark_mode==False, 'read_time'])  -0.4446330948042103  Individuals that select the dark_mode spend on average 1.37 hours less on the blog, per week. Should we conclude that dark_mode is a bad idea? Is this a causal effect?\nWe did not randomize the dark_mode so that users that selected it might not be directly comparable with users that didn\u0026rsquo;t. Can we verify this concern? Partially. We can only check characteristics that we observe, gender, age and total hours in our setting. We cannot check if users differ along other dimensions that we don\u0026rsquo;t observe.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use the create_table_one function from Uber\u0026rsquo;s causalml package to produce a covariate balance table, containing the average value of our observable characteristics, across treatment and control groups. As the name suggests, this should always be the first table you present in causal inference analysis.\nfrom causalml.match import create_table_one X = ['male', 'age', 'hours'] table1 = create_table_one(df, 'dark_mode', X) table1   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Control Treatment SMD   Variable        n 151 149    age 46.01 (9.79) 39.09 (11.53) -0.6469   hours 337.78 (464.00) 328.57 (442.12) -0.0203   male 0.34 (0.47) 0.66 (0.48) 0.6732     There seems to be some difference between treatment (dark_mode) and control group. In particular, users that select the dark_mode are older, have spent less hours on the blog and they are more likely to be males.\nAnother way to visually observe all the differences at once is with a paired violinplot. The advantage of the paired violinplot is that it allows us to observe the full distribution of the variable (approximated via kernel density estimation).\ndef plot_distributions(df, X, d): df_long = df.copy()[X + [d]] df_long[X] =(df_long[X] - df_long[X].mean()) / df_long[X].std() df_long = pd.melt(df_long, id_vars=d, value_name='value') sns.violinplot(y=\u0026quot;variable\u0026quot;, x=\u0026quot;value\u0026quot;, hue=d, data=df_long, split=True).\\ set(xlabel=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, ylabel=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, title=\u0026quot;Normalized Variable Distribution\u0026quot;);  plot_distributions(df, X, \u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;)  The insight of the violinplot is very similar: it seems that users that select the dark_mode are different from users that don\u0026rsquo;t.\nWhy do we care?\nIf we do not control for the observable characteristics, we are unable to estimate the true treatment effect. In short, we cannot be certain that the difference in outcome, read_time, can be attributed to the treatment, dark_mode, instead of other characteristics. For example, it could be that males read less and also prefer the dark_mode, therefore we observe a negative correlation even though dark_mode has no effect on read_time (or even positive).\nIn terms of Dyrected Acyclic Graphs, this means that we have several backdoor paths that we need to block in order for our analysis to be causal.\nflowchart TB classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; X1((gender)) X2((age)) X3((hours)) D((dark mode)) Y((read time)) D --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; D X2 --\u0026gt; D X3 --\u0026gt; Y linkStyle 0 stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:4px; linkStyle 1,2 stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:4px; class D,Y included; class X1,X2,X3 excluded;  How do we block backdoor paths? By conditioning the analysis on those intermediate variables. The conditional analysis allows us to recover the average treatment effect of the dark_mode on read_time.\nflowchart TB classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; X1((gender)) X2((age)) X3((hours)) D((dark mode)) Y((read time)) D --\u0026gt; Y X1 -.-\u0026gt; Y X1 -.-\u0026gt; D X2 --\u0026gt; D X3 --\u0026gt; Y linkStyle 0 stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:4px; class D,Y,X1,X2,X3 included;  How do we condition the analysis on gender, age and hours? We have some options:\n Matching Propensity score weighting Regression with control variables  Let\u0026rsquo;s explore and compare them!\nConditional Analysis We assume that for a set of subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ we observed a tuple $(D_i, Y_i, X_i)$ comprised of\n a treatment assignment $D_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ (dark_mode) a response $Y_i \\in \\mathbb R$ (read_time) a feature vector $X_i \\in \\mathbb R^n$ (gender, age and hours)  Assumption 1 : unconfoundedness (or ignorability, or selection on observables)\n$$ \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ X_i $$\ni.e. conditional on observable characteristics $X$, the treatment assignment $D$ is as good as random. What we are effectively assuming is that there is no other characteristics that we do not observe that could impact both whether a user selects the dark_mode and their read_time. This is a strong assumption that is more likely to be satisfied the more individual characteristics we observe.\nAssumption 2: overlap (or common support)\n$$ \\exists \\eta \u0026gt; 0 \\ : \\ \\eta \\leq \\mathbb E \\left[ T_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right] \\leq 1-\\eta $$\ni.e. no observation is deterministically assigned to the treatment or control group. This is a more technical assumption that basically means that for any level of gender, age or hours, there could exist an individual that select the dark_mode and one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Differently from the unconfoundedness assumption, the overal assumption is testable.\nMatching The first and most intuitive method to perform conditional analysis is matching.\nThe idea of matching is very simple. Since we are not sure whether, for example, male and female users are directly comparable, we do the analysis within gender. Instead of comparing read_time across dark_mode in the whole sample, we do it separately for male and female users.\ndf_gender = pd.pivot_table(df, values='read_time', index='male', columns='dark_mode', aggfunc=np.mean) df_gender['diff'] = df_gender[1] - df_gender[0] df_gender   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n dark_mode False True diff   male        0 20.318000 22.24902 1.931020   1 16.933333 16.89898 -0.034354     Now the effect of dark_mode seems reversed: it is negative for male users (-0.79) but bigger and positive for female users (+1.38), suggesting a positive aggregate effect, 1.38 - 0.79 = 0.59 (assuming equal proportion of genders)! This sign reversal is a very classical example of the Simpson\u0026rsquo;s Paradox.\nThis comparison was easy to perform for gender, since it is a binary variable. With multiple variables, potentially continuous, matching becomes much more difficult. One common strategy is to match users in the treatment group with the most similar user in the control group, using some sort of nearest neighbor algorithm. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into the algorithm details here, but we can perform the matching with the NearestNeighborMatch function from the causalml package.\nThe NearestNeighborMatch function generates a new dataset where users in the treatment group have been matched 1:1 (option ratio=1) to users in the control group.\nfrom causalml.match import NearestNeighborMatch psm = NearestNeighborMatch(replace=True, ratio=1, random_state=1) df_matched = psm.match(data=df, treatment_col=\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;, score_cols=X)  Are the two groups more comparable now? We can produce a new version of the balance table.\ntable1_matched = create_table_one(df_matched, \u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;, X) table1_matched   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Control Treatment SMD   Variable        n 104 104    age 41.93 (10.05) 41.85 (10.02) -0.0086   hours 206.92 (309.62) 209.48 (321.79) 0.0081   male 0.62 (0.49) 0.62 (0.49) 0.0     Now the average differences between the two groups have shrunk by at least a couple of orders of magnitude. However, note how the sample size has slightly decreased (300 $\\to$ 246) since (1) we only match treated users and (2) we are not able to find a good match for all of them.\nWe can visually inspect distributional differences with the paired violinplot.\nplot_distributions(df_matched, X, \u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;)  A popular way to visualize pre- and post-matching covariate balance is the balance plot that essentially displays the standardized mean differences before and after matching, for each control variable.\ndef plot_balance(t1, t2, X): df_smd = pd.DataFrame({\u0026quot;Variable\u0026quot;: X + X, \u0026quot;Sample\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;Unadjusted\u0026quot; for _ in range(len(X))] + [\u0026quot;Adjusted\u0026quot; for _ in range(len(X))], \u0026quot;Standardized Mean Difference\u0026quot;: t1[\u0026quot;SMD\u0026quot;][1:].to_list() + t2[\u0026quot;SMD\u0026quot;][1:].to_list()}) sns.scatterplot(x=\u0026quot;Standardized Mean Difference\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;Variable\u0026quot;, hue=\u0026quot;Sample\u0026quot;, data=df_smd).\\ set(title=\u0026quot;Balance Plot\u0026quot;) plt.axvline(x=0, color='k', ls='--', zorder=-1, alpha=0.3);  plot_balance(table1, table1_matched, X)  As we can see, now all differences in observable characteristics between the two groups are essentially zero. We could also compare the distributions using other metrics or test statistics, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic.\nHow do we estimate the average treatment effect? We can simply do a difference in means. An equivalent way that automatically provides standard errors is to run a linear regression of the outcome, read_time, on the treatment, dark_mode.\nNote that, since we have performed the matching for each treated user, the treatment effect we are estimating is the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), which can be different from the average treatment effect if the treated sample differs from the overall population (which is likely to be the case, since we are doing matching in the first place).\nsmf.ols(\u0026quot;read_time ~ dark_mode\u0026quot;, data=df_matched).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  17.0365  0.469  36.363  0.000  16.113  17.960   dark_mode[T.True]  1.4490  0.663  2.187  0.030  0.143  2.755   The effect is now positive, but not statistically significant.\nNote that we might have matched multiple treated users with the same untreated user, violating the independence assumption across observations and, in turn, distorting inference.\nWe have two solutions:\n cluster standard errors at the matched individual level compute standard errors via bootstrap  We implement the first and cluster the standard errors by the original individual identifiers (the dataframe index).\nsmf.ols(\u0026quot;read_time ~ dark_mode\u0026quot;, data=df_matched)\\ .fit(cov_type='cluster', cov_kwds={'groups': df_matched.index})\\ .summary().tables[1]    coef std err z P|z| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  17.0365  0.650  26.217  0.000  15.763  18.310   dark_mode[T.True]  1.4490  0.821  1.765  0.078  -0.160  3.058   The effect is even less statistically significant.\nPropensity Score Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) proved a very powerful result: if the strong ignorability assumption holds, it is sufficient to condition the analysis on the probability ot treatment, the propensity score, in order to have conditional independence.\n$$ \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ X_i \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ e(X_i) $$\nWhere $e(X_i)$ is the probability of treatment of individual $i$, given the observable characteristics $X_i$.\n$$ e(x) = \\Pr \\left( D_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right) $$\nNote that in an AB test the propensity score is constant across individuals.\nThe result from Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) is incredibly powerful and practical, since the propensity score is a one dimensional variable, while $X$ might be very high dimensional.\nUnder the unconfoundedness assumption introduced above, we can rewrite the average treatment effect as\n$$ \\tau(x) = \\mathbb E \\left[ Y^{(1)} - Y^{(0)} \\ \\big| \\ X = x \\right] = \\mathbb E \\left[ \\frac{D_i Y_i}{e(X_i)} - \\frac{(1-D_i) Y_i}{1-e(X_i)} \\right] $$\nNote that this formulation of the average treatment effect does not depend on the potential outcomes $Y_i^{(1)}$ and $Y_i^{(0)}$, but only on the observed outcomes $Y_i$.\nThis formulation of the average treatment effect implies the Inverse Propensity Weighted (IPW) estimator which is an unbiased estimator for the average treatment effect $\\tau$.\n$$ \\hat \\tau^{IPW} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum _ {i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{D_i Y_i}{e(X_i)} - \\frac{(1-D_i) Y_i}{1-e(X_i)} \\right) $$\nThis estimator is unfeasible since we do not observe the propensity scores $e(X_i)$. However, we can estimate them. Actually, Imbens, Hirano, Ridder (2003) show that you should use the estimated propensity scores even if you knew the true values (for example because you know the sampling procedure). The idea is that if the estimated propensity scores are different from the true ones, this can be informative in the estimation.\nThere are several possible ways to estimate a probability, the simplest and most common one being logistic regression.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV df[\u0026quot;pscore\u0026quot;] = LogisticRegressionCV().fit(y=df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;], X=df[X]).predict_proba(df[X])[:,1]  It is best practice, whenever we fit a prediction model, to fit the model on a different sample with respect to the one that we use for inference. This practice is usually called cross-validation or cross-fitting. One of the best (but computationally expensive) cross-validation procedures is leave-one-out (LOO) cross-fitting: when predicting the value of observation $i$ we use all observations except for $i$. We implement the LOO cross-fitting procedure using the cross_val_predict and LeaveOneOut functions from the sklearn package.\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict, LeaveOneOut df['pscore'] = cross_val_predict(estimator=LogisticRegressionCV(), X=df[X], y=df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;], cv=LeaveOneOut(), method='predict_proba', n_jobs=-1)[:,1]  An important check to perform after estimating propensity scores is plotting them, across the treatment and control groups. First of all, we can then observe whether the two groups are balanced or not, depending on how close the two distributions are. Moreover, we can also check how likely it is that the overlap assumption is satisfied. Ideally both distributions should span the same interval.\nsns.histplot(data=df, x='pscore', hue='dark_mode', bins=30, stat='density', common_norm=False).\\ set(ylabel=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;, title=\u0026quot;Distribution of Propensity Scores\u0026quot;);  As expected, the distribution of propensity scores between the treatment and control group is significantly different, suggesting that the two groups are hardly comparable. However, there is significant overlap in the support of the distributions, suggesting that the overlap assumption is likely to be satisfied.\nHow do we estimate the average treatment effect?\nOnce we have computed the propensity scores, we just need to re-weight observations by their respective propensity score. We can then either compute a difference between the weighted read_time averages, or run a weighted regression of read_time on dark_mode.\nw = 1 / (df[\u0026quot;pscore\u0026quot;] * df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;] + (1-df[\u0026quot;pscore\u0026quot;]) * (1-df[\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;])) smf.wls(\u0026quot;read_time ~ dark_mode\u0026quot;, weights=w, data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  18.5859  0.412  45.110  0.000  17.775  19.397   dark_mode[T.True]  1.1303  0.582  1.942  0.053  -0.015  2.276   The effect of the dark_mode is now positive and almost statistically significant, at the 5% level.\nNote that the wls function automatically normalizes weights so that they sum to 1, which greatly improves the stability of the estimator. In fact, the unnormalized IPW estimator can be very unstable when the propensity scores approach zero or one.\nAlso note that the standard errors are not correct, since they do not take into account the extra uncertainty introduced in the estimation of the propensity score. This issue was noted by Abadie and Imbens (2016).\nRegression with Control Variables The last method we are going to review today is linear regression with control variables. This estimator is extremely easy to implement, since we just need to add the user characteristics - gender, age and hours - to the regression of read_time on dark_mode.\nsmf.ols(\u0026quot;read_time ~ dark_mode + male + age + hours\u0026quot;, data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  16.8591  1.082  15.577  0.000  14.729  18.989   dark_mode[T.True]  1.3858  0.524  2.646  0.009  0.355  2.417   male  -4.4855  0.499  -8.990  0.000  -5.468  -3.504   age  0.0513  0.022  2.311  0.022  0.008  0.095   hours  0.0043  0.001  8.427  0.000  0.003  0.005   The average treatment effect is again positive and statistically significant at the 1% level!\nComparison How do the different methods compare to each other?\nIPW and Regression There is a tight connection between the IPW estimator and linear regression with covariates. This is particularly evident when we have a one-dimensional, discrete covariate $X$.\nIn this case, the estimand of IPW (i.e. the quantity that IPW estimates) is given by\n$$ \\tau^{IPW} = \\frac{ \\sum_x \\color{red}{\\tau_x} \\color{blue}{\\Pr(D_i | X_i = x)} \\Pr(X_i = x)}{\\sum_x \\color{blue}{\\Pr(D_i | X_i = x)} \\Pr(X_i = x)} $$\nThe IPW estimand is a weighted average of the treatment effects $\\tau_x$, where the weights are given by the treatment probabilities.\nOn the other hand, the estimand of linear regression with control variables is\n$$ \\tau^{OLS} = \\frac{ \\sum_x \\color{red}{\\tau_x} \\color{blue}{\\Pr(D_i | X_i = x)(1 - \\Pr(D_i | X_i = x)) } \\Pr(X_i = x)}{\\sum_x \\color{blue}{\\Pr(D_i | X_i = x)(1 - \\Pr(D_i | X_i = x)) } \\Pr(X_i = x)} $$\nThe OLS estimand is a weighted average of the treatment effects $\\tau_x$, where the weights are given by the variances of the treatment probabilities. This means that linear regression is a weighted estimator, that gives more weight to observations that have characteristics for which we observe more treatment variability. Since a binary random variable has the highest variance when its expected value is 0.5, OLS gives the most weight to observations that have characteristics for which we observe a 50/50 split between treatment and control group. On the other hand, if for some characteristics we only observe treated or untreated individuals, those observations are going to receive zero weight. I recommend Chapter 3 of Angrist and Pischke (2009) for more details.\nIPW and Matching As we have seen in the IPW section, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) result tells us that we do not need to perform the analysis conditional on all the covariates $X$, but it is sufficient to condition on the propensity score $e(X)$.\nWe have seed how this result implies a weighted estimator but it also extends to matching: we do not need to match observations on all the covariates $X$, but it is sufficient to match them on the propensity score $e(X)$. This method is called propensity score matching.\npsm = NearestNeighborMatch(replace=False, random_state=1) df_ipwmatched = psm.match(data=df, treatment_col=\u0026quot;dark_mode\u0026quot;, score_cols=['pscore'])  As before, after matching, we can simply compute the estimate as a difference in means, remembering that observations are not independent and therefore we need to be cautious when doing inference.\nsmf.ols(\u0026quot;read_time ~ dark_mode\u0026quot;, data=df_ipwmatched)\\ .fit(cov_type='cluster', cov_kwds={'groups': df_ipwmatched.index})\\ .summary().tables[1]    coef std err z P|z| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  18.4633  0.505  36.576  0.000  17.474  19.453   dark_mode[T.True]  1.1888  0.703  1.692  0.091  -0.188  2.566   The estimated effect of dark_mode is positive, significant at the 1% level and very close to the true value of 2!\nConclusion In this blog post, we have seen how to perform conditional analysis using different approached. Matching directly matches most similar units in the treatment and control group. Weighting simply assigns different weight to different observations depending on their probability of receiving the treatment. Regression instead weights observations depending on the conditional treatment variances, giving more weight to observations that have characteristics common to both the treatment and control group.\nThese procedures are extremely helpful because they can either allow us to estimate causal effects from (very rich) observational data or correct experimental estimates when randomization was not perfect or we have a small sample.\nLast but not least, if you want to know more, I strongly recommend this video lecture on propensity scores from Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham that is freely available online.\n  The whole course is a gem and it is an incredible privilege to have such high quality material available online for free!\nReferences [1] P.

We might be interested in understanding if a drug has side effects that are different for people of different age. Or we might be interested in understanding if an ad campaign is particularly effective in certain geographical areas.\nThis knowledge is crucial because it allows us to target the treatment. If a drug has severe side effects for kids, we might want to restrict its distribution only to adults. Or if an ad campaign is effective only in English-speaking countries it is not worth showing it elsewhere.\nIn this blog post we are going to explore some approaches to uncover treatment effect heterogeneity. In particular, we are going to explore methods that try to leverage the flexibility of machine learning algorithms.\nExample Suppose we were a company interested in understanding how much a new premium feature increases revenue. In particular, we know that users of different age have different spending attitudes and we suspect that the impact of the premium feature could also be different depending on the age of the user.\nThis information might be very important, for example for advertisement targeting or discount design. If we discover that the premium feature increases revenue for a particular set of users, we might want to target advertisement towards that group, or offer them personalized discounts.\nTo understand the effect of the premium feature on revenue, the run an AB test in which we randomly give access to the premium feature to 10% of the users. The feature is expensive and we cannot afford to give it for free to more users. Hopefully a 10% treatment probability is enough.\nWe generate the simulated data using the data generating process dgp_premium() from src.dgp. I also import some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_premium  dgp = dgp_premium() df = dgp.generate_data(seed=5) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  revenue premium age     0 10.62 True 27.32   1 10.35 True 54.57   2 10.13 False 26.68   3 9.97 False 56.58   4 10.16 False 38.51     We have data on 300 users, for whom we observe the revenue they generate and whether they were given the premium feature. Moreover, we also record the age of the users.\nTo understand whether randomization worked, we use the create_table_one function from Uber\u0026rsquo;s causalml package to produce a covariate balance table, containing the average value of our observable characteristics, across treatment and control groups. As the name suggests, this should always be the first table you present in causal inference analysis.\nfrom causalml.match import create_table_one create_table_one(df, 'premium', ['age', 'revenue'])   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Control Treatment SMD   Variable        n 269 31    age 39.01 (12.11) 38.43 (13.26) -0.0454   revenue 10.04 (0.16) 10.56 (0.23) 2.5905     Most users are in the control group and only 31 users have received the premium feature. Average age is comparable across groups (SMD\u0026lt;1), while it seems that the premium feature increases revenue by 2.6$ per user, on average.\nDoes the effect of the premium feature differ by age?\nOne simple approach could me to regress revenue on a full interaction of premium and age.\nlinear_model = smf.ols('revenue ~ premium * age', data=df).fit() linear_model.summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  10.0244  0.034  292.716  0.000  9.957  10.092   premium[T.True]  0.5948  0.099  6.007  0.000  0.400  0.790   age  0.0005  0.001  0.570  0.569  -0.001  0.002   premium[T.True]:age  -0.0021  0.002  -0.863  0.389  -0.007  0.003   The interaction coefficient is close to zero and not significant. It seems that there is not a different effect of premium by age. But is it true? The interaction coefficient only captures linear relationships. What if the relationship is non-linear?\nWe can check it by directly plotting the raw data. We plot revenue by age, splitting the data between premium users and non-premium users.\nsns.scatterplot(data=df, x='age', y='revenue', hue='premium', s=40);  From the raw data, it looks like revenue is generally higher for people between 30 and 40 and premium has a particularly strong effect for people between 35 and 45/50.\nWe can visualize the estimated revenue by age with and without treatment.\ndef plot_TE(df, true_te=False): sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='age', y='revenue', hue='premium', s=40, legend=True) sns.lineplot(df['age'], df['mu0_hat'], label='$\\mu_0$') sns.lineplot(df['age'], df['mu1_hat'], label='$\\mu_1$') if true_te: plt.fill_between(df['age'], df['y0'], df['y0'] + df['y1'], color='grey', alpha=0.2, label=\u0026quot;True TE\u0026quot;) plt.title('Distribution of revenue by age and premium status') plt.legend(title='Treated')  We first compute the predicted revenue with ($\\mu_1$) and without premium subscription ($\\mu_0$) and we plot them together with the raw data.\ndf['mu0_hat'] = linear_model.predict(df.assign(premium=0)) df['mu1_hat'] = linear_model.predict(df.assign(premium=1)) plot_TE(df)  As we can see, the orange line is higher than the blue line, suggesting a positive effect of premium on revenue. However, the two lines are essentially parallel, suggesting no heterogeneity in treatment effects.\nCan we be more precise? Is there a way to estimate this treatment heterogeneity in a flexible way, without assuming functional forms?\nThe answer is yes! We can use machine learning methods to flexibly estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. In particular, in this blog post we are going to inspect three and popular methods that were introduced by Künzel, Sekhon, Bickel, Yu, (2019):\n S-learner T-learner X-learner  Setting We assume that for a set of i.i.d. subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ we observed a tuple $(X_i, D_i, Y_i)$ comprised of\n a treatment assignment $T_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ (premium) a response $Y_i \\in \\mathbb R$ (revenue) a feature vector $X_i \\in \\mathbb R^n$ (age)  We are interested in estimating the average treatment effect.\n$$ \\tau = \\mathbb E \\Big[ Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)} \\Big] $$\nWhere $Y_i^{(d)}$ indicates the potential outcome of individual $i$ under treatment status $d$. We also make the following assumptions.\nAssumption 1 : unconfoundedness (or ignorability, or selection on observables)\n$$ \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ X_i $$\ni.e. conditional on observable characteristics $X$, the treatment assignment $D$ is as good as random. What we are effectively assuming is that there is no other characteristics that we do not observe that could impact both whether a user selects the dark_mode and their read_time. This is a strong assumption that is more likely to be satisfied the more individual characteristics we observe.\nAssumption 2: stable unit treatment value (SUTVA)\n$$ Y^{(d)} \\perp D $$\ni.e. the potential outcome does not depend on the treatment status. In our case, we are ruling out the fact that another user selecting the premium feature might affect my effect of premium on revenue. The most common setting where SUTVA is violated is in presence of network effects: if a friend of mine uses a social network increases my utility from using it.\nS-Learner The simplest meta-algorithm is the single learner or S-learner. To build the S-learner estimator, we fit a single model for all observations.\n$$ \\mu(z) = \\mathbb E \\left[ Y_i \\ \\big | \\ (X_i, D_i) = z \\right] $$\nthe estimator is given by the difference between the predicted values evaluated with and without the treatment, $d=1$ and $d=0$.\n$$ \\hat \\tau_{S} (x) = \\hat \\mu(x,1) - \\hat \\mu(x,0) $$\ndef S_learner(dgp, model, y, D, X): temp = dgp.generate_data(true_te=True).sort_values(X) mu = model.fit(temp[X + [D]], temp[y]) temp['mu0_hat'] = mu.predict(temp[X + [D]].assign(premium=0)) temp['mu1_hat'] = mu.predict(temp[X + [D]].assign(premium=1)) plot_TE(temp, true_te=True)  Let\u0026rsquo;s use a decision tree regression model to build the the S-learner, using the DecisionTreeRegressor function from the sklearn package. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into details about decision trees here, but I will just say that it\u0026rsquo;s a non-parametric estimator that uses the training data to split the state space (premium and age in our case) into blocks and predicts the outcome (revenue in our case) as its average value within block.\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor model = DecisionTreeRegressor(min_impurity_decrease=0.001) S_learner(dgp, model, y=\u0026quot;revenue\u0026quot;, D=\u0026quot;premium\u0026quot;, X=[\u0026quot;age\u0026quot;])  The plot depicts the data together with the response functions $\\hat \\mu(x,1)$ and $\\hat \\mu(x,0)$. I have also plotted in grey the area between the true response functions: the true treatment effects.\nAs we can see, the S-learner is flexible enough to understand that there is a difference in levels between treatment and control group (we have two separate lines). It also captures well the response function for the control group, $\\hat \\mu(x,0)$, but not so well the control function for the treatment group, $\\hat \\mu(x,1)$.\nThe problem with the S-learner is that it is learning a single model so we have to hope that the model uncovers heterogeneity in the treatment $D$, but it might not be the case. Moreover, if the model is heavily regularized because of the high dimensionality of $X$, it might not recover any treatment effect. For example, with decision trees, we might not split on the treatment $D$.\nT-learner To build the two-learner or T-learner estimator, we fit two different models, one for treated units and one for control units.\n$$ \\mu^{(1)}(x) = \\mathbb E \\left[ Y_i \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x, T_i = 1 \\right] \\qquad ; \\qquad \\mu^{(0)}(x) = \\mathbb E \\left[ Y_i \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x, T_i = 0 \\right] $$\nthe estimator is given by the difference between the predicted values of the two algorithms.\n$$ \\hat \\tau_{T} (x) = \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(x) - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(x) $$\ndef T_learner(df, model, y, D, X): temp = dgp.generate_data(true_te=True).sort_values(X) mu0 = model.fit(temp.loc[temp[D]==0, X], temp.loc[temp[D]==0, y]) temp['mu0_hat'] = mu0.predict(temp[X]) mu1 = model.fit(temp.loc[temp[D]==1, X], temp.loc[temp[D]==1, y]) temp['mu1_hat'] = mu1.predict(temp[X]) plot_TE(temp, true_te=True)  We use a decision tree regression model as before but, this time, we fit two separate decision trees for the treatment and control group.\nT_learner(dgp, model, y=\u0026quot;revenue\u0026quot;, D=\u0026quot;premium\u0026quot;, X=[\u0026quot;age\u0026quot;])  As we can see, the T-learner is much more flexible than the S-learner because it fits two separate models. The response function for the control group, $\\hat \\mu(x,0)$, is still very accurate and the response function for the treatment group, $\\hat \\mu(x,1)$, is more flexible than before.\nThe problem now is that we are using just a fraction of the data for each prediction problem, while the S-learner was using all the data. By fitting two separate models we are losing some information. Moreover, by using two different models we might get heterogeneity where there is none. For example, with decision trees, we will probably get different splits with different samples even if the data generating process is the same.\nX-learner The cross-learner or X-learner estimator is an extension of the T-learner estimator. It is built in the following way:\n  As for the T-learner, compute separate models for $\\mu^{(1)}(x)$ and $\\mu^{(0)}(x)$ using the treated and control units, respectively\n  Compute the estimated treatment effects as\n  $$ \\Delta_i (x) = \\begin{cases} Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(x) \u0026amp;\\quad \\text{ if } D_i = 1 \\newline \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(x) - Y_i \u0026amp;\\quad \\text{ if } D_i = 0 \\end{cases} $$\n Predicting $\\Delta$ from $X$, compute $\\hat \\tau^{(0)}(x)$ from treated units and $\\hat \\tau^{(1)}(x)$ from control units\n  Estimate the propensity score\n  $$ e(x) = \\mathbb E \\left[ D_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right] $$\nCompute the treatment effects  $$ \\hat \\tau_X(x) = \\hat \\tau^{(0)}(x) \\hat e(x) + \\hat \\tau^{(1)}(x) (1 - \\hat e(x)) $$\nCan we still recover pseudo response functions? Yes!\nWhich we can rewrite the treatment effects as\n$$ \\begin{align} \\hat \\tau_X(x) \u0026amp; = \\hat \\tau^{(0)}(x) \\hat e(x) + \\hat \\tau^{(1)}(x) (1 - \\hat e(x)) = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\hat e(x) \\left[ \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(x) - Y_i^{(0)} \\right] + (1 - \\hat e(x)) \\left[ Y_i^{(1)} - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(x) \\right] = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\left[ \\hat e(x) \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(x) + (1 - \\hat e(x)) Y_i^{(1)} \\right] - \\left[ \\hat e(x) Y_i^{(0)} + (1 - \\hat e(x)) \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(x) \\right] \\end{align} $$\nSo that the pseudo response functions estimated by the X-learner are\n$$ \\begin{align} \\tilde \\mu_i^{(1)} (x) \u0026amp;= \\hat e(x) \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(x) + (1 - \\hat e(x)) Y_i^{(1)} \\newline \\tilde \\mu_i^{(0)} (x) \u0026amp;= \\hat e(x) Y_i^{(0)} + (1 - \\hat e(x)) \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(x) \\end{align} $$\nAs we can see, the X-learner combines the true values $Y_i^{(d)}$ with the estimated ones $\\mu_i^{(d)} (x)$ weighting by the propensity scores $e_i(x)$, i.e. the estimated treatment probabilities.\nWhat does it mean? It means that if we have many more observations for one group (in our case the control group), the control response function $\\hat \\mu^{(0)}(x) $ will get most of the weight. Instead, for the other group (the treatment group in our case), the actual observations $Y_i^{(1)}$ will get most of the weight.\nTo illustrate the method, I am going to build pseudo response functions by approximating $Y_i^{(d)}$ using the nearest observation, using the KNeighborsRegressor function. I estimate the propensity scores via logistic regression using the LogisticRegressionCV function.\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV def X_learner(df, model, y, D, X): temp = dgp.generate_data(true_te=True).sort_values(X) # Mu mu0 = model.fit(temp.loc[temp[D]==0, X], temp.loc[temp[D]==0, y]) temp['mu0_hat_'] = mu0.predict(temp[X]) mu1 = model.fit(temp.loc[temp[D]==1, X], temp.loc[temp[D]==1, y]) temp['mu1_hat_'] = mu1.predict(temp[X]) # Y y0 = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=1).fit(temp.loc[temp[D]==0, X], temp.loc[temp[D]==0, y]) temp['y0_hat'] = y0.predict(temp[X]) y1 = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=1).fit(temp.loc[temp[D]==1, X], temp.loc[temp[D]==1, y]) temp['y1_hat'] = y1.predict(temp[X]) # Weight e = LogisticRegressionCV().fit(y=temp[D], X=temp[X]).predict_proba(temp[X])[:,1] temp['mu0_hat'] = e * temp['y0_hat'] + (1-e) * temp['mu0_hat_'] temp['mu1_hat'] = (1-e) * temp['y1_hat'] + e * temp['mu1_hat_'] # Plot plot_TE(temp, true_te=True)  X_learner(df, model, y=\u0026quot;revenue\u0026quot;, D=\u0026quot;premium\u0026quot;, X=[\u0026quot;age\u0026quot;])  As we can clearly see from this graph, the main advantage of X-learners is that it adapts the flexibility of the response functions to the context. In areas of the state space where we have a lot of data, it mostly uses the estimated response function, in areas of the state space with few data, it uses the observation themselves.\nConclusion In this post, we have seen different estimators introduced by Künzel, Sekhon, Bickel, Yu, (2019) that leverage flexible machine learning algorithms to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects. The estimators differ for their degree of sophistication: the S-learner fits a single estimator including the treatment indicator as a covariate. The T-learner fits two separate estimators for the treatment and control group. Lastly, the X-learner is an extension of the T-learner that allows for different degrees of flexibility depending on the amount of data available across treatment and control groups.\nEstimation of heterogeneous treatment effect is extremely important for treatment targeting. Indeed, there is now a growing literature that exploits machine learning methods to get flexible estimates without imposing functional form assumptions. Among the many, it\u0026rsquo;s important to mention the R-learner procedure of Nie and Wager (2021) and the causal trees and forests of Athey and Wager (2018). I might write more about these procedures in the future so, stay tuned ☺️\nReferences [1] S. Künzel, J. Sekhon, P. Bickel, B.

However, I was completely clueless when I first heard of CUPED (Controlled-Experiment using Pre-Experiment Data), a technique to increase the power of randomized controlled trials in A/B tests.\nWhat really amazed me was the popularity of the algorithm in the industry. CUPED was first introduced by Microsoft researchers Deng, Xu, Kohavi, Walker (2013) and has been widely used in companies such as Netflix, Booking, Meta, Airbnb, TripAdvisor, DoorDash, Faire, and many others. While digging deeper into it, I noticed a similarity with some causal inference methods I was familiar with, such as Difference-in-Differences. I was curious and decided to dig deeper.\nIn this post, I will present CUPED and try to compare it against other causal inference methods.\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we are a firm that is testing an ad campaign and we are interested in understanding whether it increases revenue or not. We randomly split a set of users into a treatment and control group and we show the ad campaign to the treatment group. Differently from the standard A/B test setting, assume we observe users also before the test.\nWe can now generate the simulated data, using the data generating process dgp_cuped() from src.dgp. I also import some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_cuped  df = dgp_cuped().generate_data() df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  i ad_campaign revenue0 revenue1     0 1 0 5.315635 8.359304   1 2 1 2.977799 7.751485   2 3 0 4.693796 9.025253   3 4 0 5.827975 8.540667   4 5 0 5.230095 8.910165     We have informations on 1000 individuals indexed by i for whom we observe the revenue generated pre and post treatment, revenue0 and revenue1 respectively, and whether they have been exposed to the ad_campaign.\nDifference in Means In randomized experiments or A/B tests, randomization allows us to estimate the average treatment effect using a simple difference in means. We can just compare the average outcome post-treatment $Y_1$ (revenue) across control and treated units and randomization guarantees that this difference is due to the treatment alone, in expectation.\n$$ \\widehat {ATE}^{simple} = \\bar Y_{t=1, d=1} - \\bar Y_{t=1, d=0} $$\nWhere the bar indicates the average over individuals. In our case, we compute the average revenue post ad campaign in the treatment group, minus the average revenue post ad campaign in the control group.\nnp.mean(df.loc[df.ad_campaign==True, 'revenue1']) - np.mean(df.loc[df.ad_campaign==False, 'revenue1'])  1.7914301325347406  The estimated treatment effect is 1.79, very close to the true value of 2. We can obtain the same estimate by regressing the post-treatment outcome revenue1 on the treatment indicator ad_campaign.\n$$ Y_{i, t=1} = \\alpha + \\beta D_i + \\varepsilon_i $$\nWhere $\\beta$ is the coefficient of interest.\nsmf.ols('revenue1 ~ ad_campaign', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  8.2995  0.211  39.398  0.000  7.881  8.718   ad_campaign  1.7914  0.301  5.953  0.000  1.194  2.389   This estimator is unbiased, which means it delivers the correct estimate, on average. However, it can still be improved: we could decrease its variance. Decreasing the variance of an estimator is extremely important since it allows us to\n detect smaller effects detect the same effect, but with a smaller sample size  In general, an estimator with a smaller variance allows us to run tests with higher power, i.e. ability to detect smaller effects.\nCan we improve the power of our AB test? Yes, with CUPED (among other methods).\nCUPED The idea of CUPED is the following. Suppose you are running an AB test and $Y$ is the outcome of interest (revenue in our example) and the binary variable $D$ indicates whether a single individual has been treated or not (ad_campaign in our example).\nSuppose you have access to another random variable $X$ which is not affected by the treatment and has known expectation $\\mathbb E[X]$. Then define\n$$ \\hat Y^{cuped}_{1} = \\bar Y_1 - \\theta \\bar X + \\theta \\mathbb E [X] $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is a scalar. This estimator is an unbiased estimator for $\\mathbb E[Y]$ since in expectation the two last terms cancel out. However, the variance of $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1}$ is\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\text{Var} \\left( \\hat Y^{cuped}_{1} \\right) \u0026amp;= \\text{Var} \\left( \\bar Y_1 - \\theta \\bar X + \\theta \\mathbb E [X] \\right) = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\text{Var} \\left( Y_1 - \\theta X \\right) / n = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\Big( \\text{Var} (Y_1) + \\theta^2 \\text{Var} (X) - 2 \\theta \\text{Cov} (X,Y) \\Big) / n \\end{aligned} $$\nNote that the variance of $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1}$ is minimized for\n$$ \\theta^* = \\frac{\\text{Cov} (X,Y)}{\\text{Var} (X)} $$\nWhich is the OLS estimator of a linear regression of $Y$ on $X$. Substituting $\\theta^*$ into the formula of the variance of $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1}$ we obtain\n$$ \\text{Var} \\left( \\hat Y^{cuped}_{1} \\right) = \\text{Var} (\\bar Y) (1 - \\rho^2) $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the correlation between $Y$ and $X$. Therefore, the higher the correlation between $Y$ and $X$, the higher the variance reduction of CUPED.\nWe can then estimate the average treatment effectas the average difference in the transformed outcome between the control and treatment group.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\widehat {ATE}^{cuped} \u0026amp;= \\hat Y^{cuped}{1} (D=1) - \\hat Y^{cuped}{1}(D=0) = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\big( \\bar Y_1 - \\theta \\bar X + \\theta \\mathbb E [X] \\ \\big| \\ D = 1 \\big) - \\big( \\bar Y_1 - \\theta \\bar X + \\theta \\mathbb E [X] \\ \\big| \\ D = 0 \\big) = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\big( \\bar Y_1 - \\theta \\bar X \\ \\big| \\ D = 1 \\big) - \\big( \\bar Y_1 - \\theta \\bar X \\ \\big| \\ D = 0 \\big) \\end{aligned} $$\nNote that $\\mathbb E[X]$ cancels out when taking the difference. Therefore, it is sufficient to compute\n$$ \\hat Y_{cuped,1}' = \\bar Y_1 - \\theta \\bar X $$\nThis is not an unbiased estimator of $\\mathbb E[Y]$ but still delivers an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect.\nOptimal X What is the optimal choice for the control variable $X$?\nWe know that $X$ should have the following properties:\n not affected by the treatment as correlated with $Y_1$ as possible  The authors of the paper suggest using the pre-treatment outcome $Y_{0}$ since it gives the most reduction in variance in practice.\nTherefore, in practice, we can compute the CUPED estimate of the average treatment effect as follows:\n Regress $Y_1$ on $Y_0$ and estimate $\\hat \\theta$ Compute $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1} = \\bar Y_1 - \\hat \\theta \\bar Y_0$ Compute the difference of $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1}$ between treatment and control group  Equivalently, we can compute $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1}$ at the individual level and then regress it on the treatment dummy variable $D$.\nBack To The Data Let\u0026rsquo;s compute the CUPED estimate for the treatment effect, one step at the time. First, let\u0026rsquo;s estimate $\\theta$.\ntheta = smf.ols('revenue1 ~ revenue0', data=df).fit().params[1]  Now we can compute the transformed outcome $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1}$.\ndf['revenue1_cuped'] = df['revenue1'] - theta * (df['revenue0'] - np.mean(df['revenue0']))  Lastly, we estimate the treatment effect as a difference in means, with the transformed outcome $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1}$.\nsmf.ols('revenue1_cuped ~ ad_campaign', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  8.2259  0.143  57.677  0.000  7.943  8.509   ad_campaign  1.9415  0.204  9.529  0.000  1.537  2.346   The standard error is 33% smaller!\nEquivalent Formulation An alternative but algebraically equivalent way of obtaining the CUPED estimate is the folowing\n Regress $Y_1$ on $Y_0$ and compute the residuals $\\tilde Y_1$ Compute $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1} = \\tilde Y_1 + \\bar Y_1$ Compute the difference of $\\hat Y^{cuped}_{1}$ between treatment and control group  Step (3) is the same as before but (1) and (2) are different. This procedure is called partialling out and the algebraic equivalence is guaranteed by the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell Theorem.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check if we indeed obtain the same result.\ndf['revenue1_tilde'] = smf.ols('revenue1 ~ revenue0', data=df).fit().resid + np.mean(df['revenue1'])  smf.ols('revenue1_tilde ~ ad_campaign', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  8.2259  0.143  57.677  0.000  7.943  8.509   ad_campaign  1.9415  0.204  9.529  0.000  1.537  2.346   Yes! The regression table is exactly identical.\nCUPED vs Other CUPED seems to be a very powerful procedure but it is remindful of at least a couple of other methods.\n Autoregression or regression with control variables Difference-in-Differences  Are these methods the same or is there a difference? Let\u0026rsquo;s check.\nAutoregression The first question that came to my mind when I first saw CUPED was \u0026ldquo;is CUPED just the simple difference with an additional control variable?\u0026rdquo;. Or equivalently, is CUPED equivalent to running the following regression\n$$ Y_{i, t=1} = \\alpha + \\beta D_i + \\gamma Y_{i, t=0} + \\varepsilon_i $$\nand estimating $\\gamma$ via least squares?\nsmf.ols('revenue1 ~ revenue0 + ad_campaign', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  1.9939  0.603  3.304  0.001  0.796  3.192   revenue0  1.2249  0.114  10.755  0.000  0.999  1.451   ad_campaign  1.9519  0.205  9.529  0.000  1.545  2.358   The estimated coefficient is very similar to the one we obtained with CUPED and also the standard error is very close. However, they are not exactly the same.\nIf you are familiar with the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell Theorem, you might wonder why the two procedures are not equivalent. The reason is that with CUPED we are partialling out only $Y$, while the FWL theorem holds when we are partialling out either X or both X and Y.\nDiff-in-Diffs The second question that came to my mind was \u0026ldquo;is CUPED just difference-in-differences?\u0026rdquo;. Difference-in-Differences (or diff-in-diffs, or DiD) is an estimator that computes the treatment effect as a double-difference instead of a single one: pre-post and treatment-control instead of just treatment-control.\n$$ \\widehat {ATE}^{DiD} = \\big( \\bar Y_{t=1, d=1} - \\bar Y_{t=1, d=0} \\big) - \\big( \\bar Y_{t=0, d=1} - \\bar Y_{t=0, d=0} \\big) $$\nThis method was initially introduced in the 19th century to estimate the causes of a Cholera epidemic in London. The main advantage of diff-in-diff is that it allows to estimate the average treatment effect also when randomization is not perfect and the treatment and control group are not comparable. The key assumption that is needed is that these difference between the treatment and control group is constant over time. By taking a double difference, we difference it out.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check how diff-in-diff works empirically. The most common way to compute the diff-in-diff estiamtor is to first reshape the data in a long format or panel format (one observation is an individual $i$ at time period $t$) and then to regress the outcome $Y$ on the full interaction between the post-treatment dummy $T$ and the treatment dummy $D$.\n$$ Y_{i,t} = \\alpha + \\beta D_i + \\gamma \\mathbb I (t=1) + \\delta D_i * \\mathbb I (t=1) + \\varepsilon_{i,t} $$\nThe estimator of the average treatment effect is the coefficient of the interaction coefficient, $\\delta$.\ndf_long = pd.wide_to_long(df, stubnames='revenue', i='i', j='t').reset_index() df_long.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  i t revenue1_tilde ad_campaign revenue1_cuped revenue     0 1 0 8.093744 0 8.093744 5.315635   1 2 0 10.164644 1 10.164644 2.977799   2 3 0 9.472203 0 9.472203 4.693796   3 4 0 7.688063 0 7.688063 5.827975   4 5 0 8.742618 0 8.742618 5.230095     The long dataset is now indexed by individuals $i$ and time $t$.

What did we miss? We didn\u0026rsquo;t cluster the standard errors!\nI won\u0026rsquo;t go in detail here on what standard error clustering means, but the intuition is the following. The statsmodels package by default computes the standard errors assuming that outcomes are independent across observations. This assumption is unlikely to be true in this setting where we observe individuals over time and we are trying to exploit this information. Clustering allows for correlation of the outcome variable within clusters. In our case, it makes sense (even without knowing the data generating process) to cluster the standard errors at the individual levels, allowing the outcome to be correlated over time for an individual $i$.\nsmf.ols('revenue ~ t * ad_campaign', data=df_long)\\ .fit(cov_type='cluster', cov_kwds={'groups': df_long['i']})\\ .summary().tables[1]    coef std err z P|z| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  5.1481  0.139  37.056  0.000  4.876  5.420   t  3.1514  0.128  24.707  0.000  2.901  3.401   ad_campaign  -0.1310  0.181  -0.724  0.469  -0.486  0.224   t:ad_campaign  1.9224  0.209  9.208  0.000  1.513  2.332   Clustering standard errors at the individual level we obtain standard errors that are comparable to the previous estimates ($\\sim 0.2$).\nNote that diff-in-diffs is equivalent to CUPED when we assume the CUPED coefficient $\\theta=1$.\ndf['revenue1_cuped2'] = df['revenue1'] - 1 * (df['revenue0'] - np.mean(df['revenue0'])) smf.ols('revenue1_cuped2 ~ ad_campaign', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  8.2353  0.145  56.756  0.000  7.947  8.523   ad_campaign  1.9224  0.207  9.274  0.000  1.511  2.334   Indeed, we obtain the same exact coefficient and almost identical standard errors!\nComparison Which method is better? From what we have seen so far, all methods seem to deliver an accurate estimate, but the simple difference has a larger standard deviation.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now compare all the methods we have seen so far via simulation. We simulate the data generating process dgp_cuped() 1000 times and we save the estimated coefficient of the following methods:\n Simple difference Autoregression Diff-in-diffs CUPED  def simulate(dgp, K=300, x='revenue0'): # Initialize coefficients results = pd.DataFrame(columns=['k', 'Estimator', 'Estimate']) # Compute coefficients for k in range(K): temp = pd.DataFrame({'k': [k] * 4, 'Estimator': ['1.

Moreover, all estimators have a very similar standard deviation, apart from the single-difference estimator!\nAlways Identical? Are the estimators always identical, or is there some difference among them?\nWe could check many different departures from the original data generating process. For simplicity, I will consider only one here: imperfect randomization. Other tweaks of the data generating process that I considered are:\n pre-treatment missing values additional covariates / control variables multiple pre-treatment periods heterogeneous treatment effects  and combinations of them. However, I found imperfect randomization to be the most informative example.\nSuppose now that randomization was not perfect and two groups are not identical. In particular, if the data generating process is\n$$ Y_{i,t} = \\alpha + \\beta D_i + \\gamma \\mathbb I (t=1) + \\delta D_i * \\mathbb I (t=1) + u_i + \\varepsilon_{i,t} $$\nassume that $\\beta \\neq 0$.\nresults_beta1 = simulate(dgp=dgp_cuped(beta=1))  Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the distribution of the estimated parameters.\nsns.kdeplot(data=results_beta1, x=\u0026quot;Estimate\u0026quot;, hue=\u0026quot;Estimator\u0026quot;); plt.axvline(x=2, c='k', ls='--'); plt.title('Simulated Distributions');  results_beta1.groupby('Estimator').agg(mean=(\u0026quot;Estimate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;), std=(\u0026quot;Estimate\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;std\u0026quot;))   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  mean std   Estimator       1.

CUPED 1.577712 0.221448     With imperfect treatment assignment, both difference-in-differences and autoregression are unbiased for the true treatment effect, however diff-in-diffs is more efficient. Both CUPED and simple difference are biased instead. Why?\nDiff-in-diffs explicily controls for systematic differences between treatment and control group that are constant over time. This is exactly what this estimator was built for. Autoregression performs some sort of matching on the additional covariate, $Y_{t=0}$, effectively controlling for these systematic differences as well, but less efficiently (if you want to know more, I wrote related posts on control variables here and here). CUPED controls for persistent heterogeneity at the individual level, but not at the treatment assignment level. Lastly, the simple difference estimator does not control for anything.\nConclusion In this post, I have analyzed an estimator of average treatment effects in AB testing, very popular in the industry: CUPED. The key idea is that, by exploiting pre-treatment data, CUPED can achieve a lower variance by controlling for individual-level variation that is persistent over time. We have also seen that CUPED is closely related but not equivalent to autoregression and difference-in-differences. The differences among the methods clearly emerge when we have imperfect randomization.\nAn interesting avenue of future research is what happens when we have a lot of pre-treatment information, either in terms of time periods or observable characteristics. Scientists from Meta, Guo, Coey, Konutgan, Li, Schoener, Goldman (2021), have analyzed this problem in a very recent paper that exploits machine learning techniques to efficiently use this extra information. This approach is closely related to the Double/Debiased Machine Learning literature.

In particular, in causal inference the problem often arises when we have to assess the quality of randomization.\nWhen we want to assess the causal effect of a policy (or UX feature, ad campaign, drug, \u0026hellip;), the golden standard in causal inference are randomized control trials, also known as A/B tests. In practice, we select a sample for the study and we randomly split it into a control and a treatment group, and we compare the outcomes between the two groups. Randomization ensures that only difference between the two groups is the treatment, on average, so that we can attribute outcome differences to the treatment effect.\nThe problem is that, despite randomization, the two groups are never identical. However, sometimes, they are not even \u0026ldquo;similar\u0026rdquo;. For example, we might have more males in one group, or older people, etc.. (we usually call these characteristics, covariates or control variables). When it happens, we cannot be certain anymore that the difference in the outcome is only due to the treatment and cannot be attributed to the inbalanced covariates instead. Therefore, it is always important, after randomization, to check whether all observed variables are balanced across groups and whether there are no systematic differences. Another option, to be certain ex-ante that certain covariates are balanced, is stratified sampling.\nIn this blog post, we are going to see different ways to compare two (or more) distributions and assess the magnitude and significance of their difference. We are going to consider two different approaches, visual and statistical. The two approaches generally trade-off intuition with rigor: from plots we can quickly assess and explore differences, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell whether these differences are systematic or due to noise.\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we need to perform an experiment on a group of individuals and we have randomized them into a treatment and control group. We would like them to be as comparable as possible, in order to attribute any difference between the two groups to the treatment effect alone. We also have divided the treatment group in different arms for testing different treatments (e.g. slight variations of the same drug).\nFor this example, I have simulated a dataset of 1000 individuals, for whom we observe a set of characteristics. I import the data generating process dgp_rnd_assignment() from src.dgp and some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_rnd_assignment df = dgp_rnd_assignment().generate_data() df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Group Arm Gender Age Income     0 control NaN 0 29.0 568.44   1 control NaN 1 32.0 596.45   2 treatment arm 3 0 29.0 380.86   3 control NaN 0 25.0 476.38   4 treatment arm 4 1 32.0 628.28     We have information on $1000$ individuals, for which we observe gender, age and weekly income. Each individual is assigned either to the treatment or control group and treated individuals are distributed across four treatment arms.\nTwo Groups - Plots Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the simplest setting: we want to compare the distribution of income across the treatment and control group. We first explore visual approaches and the statistical approaches. The advantage of the first is intuition while the advantage of the second is rigor.\nFor most visualizations I am going to use Python\u0026rsquo;s seaborn library.\nBoxplot A first visual approach is the boxplot. The boxplot is a good trade-off between summary statistics and data visualization. The center of the box represents the median while the borders represent the first (Q1) and third quartile (Q3), respectively. The whiskers instead, extend to the first data points that are more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (Q3 - Q1) outside the box. The points that fall outside of the whiskers are plotted individually and are usually considered outliers.\nTherefore, the boxplot provides both summary statistics (the box and the whiskers) and direct data visualization (the outliers).\nsns.boxplot(data=df, x='Group', y='Income'); plt.title(\u0026quot;Boxplot\u0026quot;);  It seems that the income distribution in the treatment group is slightly more dispersed: the orange box is larger and its whiskers cover a wider range. However, the issue with the boxplot is that it hides the shape of the data, telling us some summary statistics but not showing us the actual data distribution.\nHistogram The most intuitive way to plot a distribution is the histogram. The histogram groups the data into equally wide bins and plots the number of observations within each bin.\nsns.histplot(data=df, x='Income', hue='Group', bins=50); plt.title(\u0026quot;Histogram\u0026quot;);  There are multiple issues with this plot:\n Since the two groups have a different number of observations, the two histograms are not comparable The number of bins is arbitrary  We can solve the first issue using the stat option to plot the density instead of the count and setting the common_norm option to False to use the same normalization.\nsns.histplot(data=df, x='Income', hue='Group', bins=50, stat='density', common_norm=False); plt.title(\u0026quot;Density Histogram\u0026quot;);  Now the two histograms are comparable!\nHowever, an important issue remains: the size of the bins is arbitrary. In the extreme, if we bunch the data less, we end up with bins with at most one observation, if we bunch the data more, we end up with a single bin. In both cases, if we exaggerate, the plot loses informativeness. This is a classical bias-variance trade-off.\nKernel Density One possible solution is to use a kernel density function that tries to approximate the histogram with a continuous function, using kernel density estimation (KDE).\nsns.kdeplot(x='Income', data=df, hue='Group', common_norm=False); plt.title(\u0026quot;Kernel Density Function\u0026quot;);  From the plot, it seems that the estimated kernel density of income has \u0026ldquo;fatter tails\u0026rdquo; (i.e. higher variance) in the treatment group, while the average seems similar across groups.\nThe issue with kernel density estimation is that it is a bit of a black-box and might mask relevant features of the data.\nCumulative Distribution A more transparent representation of the two distribution is their cumulative distribution function. At each point of the x axis (income) we plot the percentage of data points that have an equal or lower value. The main advantages of the cumulative distribution function are that\n we do not need to make any arbitrary choice (e.g. number of bins) we do not need to perform any approximation (e.g. with KDE), but we represent all data points  sns.histplot(x='Income', data=df, hue='Group', bins=len(df), stat=\u0026quot;density\u0026quot;, element=\u0026quot;step\u0026quot;, fill=False, cumulative=True, common_norm=False); plt.title(\u0026quot;Cumulative distribution function\u0026quot;);  How should we interpret the graph?\n  Since the two lines cross more or less at 0.5 (y axis), it means that their median is similar\n  Since the orange line is above the blue line on the left and below the blue line on the left, it means that the distribution of the treatment group as fatter tails\n  QQ Plot A related method is the qq-plot, where q stands for quantile. The qq-plot plots the quantiles of the two distributions against each other. If the distributions are the same, we should get a 45 degree line.\nThere is no native qq-plot function in Python and, while the statsmodels package provides a qqplot function, it is quite cumbersome. Therefore, we will do it by hand.\nFirst, we need to compute the quartiles of the two groups, using the percentile function.\nincome = df['Income'].values income_t = df.loc[df.Group=='treatment', 'Income'].values income_c = df.loc[df.Group=='control', 'Income'].values df_pct = pd.DataFrame() df_pct['q_treatment'] = np.percentile(income_t, range(100)) df_pct['q_control'] = np.percentile(income_c, range(100))  Now we can plot the two quantile distributions against each other, plus the 45-degree line, representing the benchmark perfect fit.\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 8)) plt.scatter(x='q_control', y='q_treatment', data=df_pct, label='Actual fit'); sns.lineplot(x='q_control', y='q_control', data=df_pct, color='r', label='Line of perfect fit'); plt.xlabel('Quantile of income, control group') plt.ylabel('Quantile of income, treatment group') plt.legend() plt.title(\u0026quot;QQ plot\u0026quot;);  The qq-plot delivers a very similar insight with respect to the cumulative distribution plot: income in the treatment group has the same median (lines cross in the center) but wider tails (dots are below the line on the left end and above on the right end).\nTwo Groups - Tests So far, we have seen different ways to visualize differences between distributions. The main advantage of visualization is intuition: we can eyeball the differences and intuitively assess them.\nHowever, we might want to be more rigorous and try to assess the statistical significance of the difference between the distributions, i.e. answer the question \u0026ldquo;is the observed difference systematic or due to sampling noise?\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are now going to analyze different tests to discern two distributions from each other.\nT-test The first and most common test is the student t-test. T-tests are generally used to compare means. In this case, we want to test whether the means of the income distribution is the same across the two groups. The test statistic for the two-means comparison test is given by:\n$$ stat = \\frac{|\\bar x_1 - \\bar x_2|}{\\sqrt{s^2 / n }} $$\nWhere $\\bar x$ is the sample mean and $s$ is the sample standard deviation. Under mild conditions, the test statistic is asymptotically distributed as a student t distribution.\nWe use the ttest_ind function from scipy to perform the t-test. The function returns both the test statistic and the implied p-value.\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind stat, p_value = ttest_ind(income_c, income_t) print(f\u0026quot;t-test: statistic={stat:.4f}, p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)  t-test: statistic=-1.5549, p-value=0.1203  The p-value of the test is $0.12$, therefore we do not reject the null hypothesis of no difference in means across treatment and control groups.\n Note: the t-test assumes that the variance in the two samples is the same so that its estimate is computed on the joint sample. Welch’s t-test allows for unequal variances in the two samples.\n Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) In general, it is good practice to always perform a test for difference in means on all variables across the treatment and control group, when we are running a randomized control trial or A/B test.\nHowever, since the denominator of the t-test statistic depends on the sample size, the t-test has been criticized for making p-values hard to compare across studies. In fact, we may obtain a significant result in an experiment with very small magnitude of difference but large sample size while we may obtain a non-significant result in an experiment with large magnitude of difference but small sample size.\nOne solution that has been proposed is the standardized mean difference (SMD). As the name suggests, this is not a proper test statistic, but just a standardized difference, which can be computed as:\n$$ SMD = \\frac{|\\bar x_1 - \\bar x_2|}{\\sqrt{(s^2_1 + s^2_2) / 2}} $$\nUsually a value below $0.1$ is considered a \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; difference.\nIt is good practice to collect average values of all variables across treatment and control group and a measure of distance between the two — either the t-test or the SMD — into a table that is called balance table. We can use the create_table_one function from the causalml library to generate it. As the name of the function suggests, the balance table should always be the first table you present when performing an A/B test.\nfrom causalml.match import create_table_one df['treatment'] = df['Group']=='treatment' create_table_one(df, 'treatment', ['Gender', 'Age', 'Income'])   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Control Treatment SMD   Variable        n 704 296    Age 32.40 (8.54) 36.42 (7.76) 0.4928   Gender 0.51 (0.50) 0.58 (0.49) 0.1419   Income 524.59 (117.35) 538.75 (160.15) 0.1009     In the first two columns, we can see the average of the different variables across the treatment and control groups, with standard errors in parenthesis. In the last column, the values of the SMD indicate a standardized difference of more than $0.1$ for all variables, suggesting that the two groups are probably different.\nMann–Whitney U Test An alternative test is the Mann–Whitney U test. The null hypothesis for this test is that the two groups have the same distribution, while the alternative hypothesis is that one group has larger (or smaller) values than the other.\nDifferently from the other tests we have seen so far, the Mann–Whitney U test is agnostic to outliers and concentrates on the center of the distribution.\nThe test procedure is the following.\n  Combine all data points and rank them (in increasing or decreasing order)\n  Compute $U_1 = R_1 - n_1(n_1 + 1)/2$, where $R_1$ is the sum of the ranks for data points in the first group and $n_1$ is the number of points in the first group.\n  Compute $U_2$ similarly for the second group.\n  The test statistic is given by $stat = min(U_1, U_2)$.\n  Under the null hypothesis of no systematic rank differences between the two distributions (i.e. same median), the test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed with known mean and variance.\nThe intuition behind the computation of $R$ and $U$ is the following: if the values in the first sample were all bigger than the values in the second sample, then $R_1 = n_1(n_1 + 1)/2$ and, as a consequence, $U_1$ would then be zero (minimum attainable value). Otherwise, if the two samples were similar, $U_1$ and $U_2$ would be very close to $n_1 n_2 / 2$ (maximum attainable value).\nWe perform the test using the mannwhitneyu function from scipy.\nfrom scipy.stats import mannwhitneyu stat, p_value = mannwhitneyu(income_t, income_c) print(f\u0026quot; Mann–Whitney U Test: statistic={stat:.4f}, p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)   Mann–Whitney U Test: statistic=106371.5000, p-value=0.6012  We get a p-value of 0.6 which implies that we do not reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two distributions.\n Note: as for the t-test, there exists a version of the Mann–Whitney U test for unequal variances in the two samples, the Brunner-Munzel test.\n Permutation Tests A non-parametric alternative is permutation testing. The idea is that, under the null hypothesis, the two distributions should be the same, therefore shuffling the group labels should not significantly alter any statistic.\nWe can chose any statistic and check how its value in the original sample compares with its distribution across group label permutations. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s use as a test statistic the difference of sample means between the treatment and control group.\nsample_stat = np.mean(income_t) - np.mean(income_c)  stats = np.zeros(1000) for k in range(1000): labels = np.random.permutation((df['Group'] == 'treatment').values) stats[k] = np.mean(income[labels]) - np.mean(income[labels==False]) p_value = np.mean(stats \u0026gt; sample_stat) print(f\u0026quot;Permutation test: p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)  Permutation test: p-value=0.0530  The permutation test gives us a p-value of $0.056$, implying a weak non-rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5% level.\nHow do we interpret the p-value? It means that the difference in means in the data is larger than $1 - 0.0560 = 94.4%$ of the differences in means across the permuted samples.\nWe can visualize the test, by plotting the distribution of the test statistic across permutations against its sample value.\nplt.hist(stats, label='Permutation Statistics', bins=30); plt.axvline(x=sample_stat, c='r', ls='--', label='Sample Statistic'); plt.legend(); plt.xlabel('Income difference between treatment and control group') plt.title('Permutation Test');  As we can see, the sample statistic is quite extreme with respect to the values in the permuted samples, but not excessively.\nChi-Squared Test The chi-squared test is a very powerful test that is mostly used to test differences in frequencies.\nOne of the least known applications of the chi-squared test, is testing the similarity between two distributions. The idea is to bin the observations of the two groups. If the two distributions were the same, we would expect the same frequency of observations in each bin. Importantly, we need enough observations in each bin, in order for the test to be valid.\nI generate bins corresponding to deciles of the distribution of income in the control group and then I compute the expected number of observations in each bin in the treatment group, if the two distributions were the same.\n# Init dataframe df_bins = pd.DataFrame() # Generate bins from control group _, bins = pd.qcut(income_c, q=10, retbins=True) df_bins['bin'] = pd.cut(income_c, bins=bins).value_counts().index # Apply bins to both groups df_bins['income_c_observed'] = pd.cut(income_c, bins=bins).value_counts().values df_bins['income_t_observed'] = pd.cut(income_t, bins=bins).value_counts().values # Compute expected frequency in the treatment group df_bins['income_t_expected'] = df_bins['income_c_observed'] / np.sum(df_bins['income_c_observed']) * np.sum(df_bins['income_t_observed']) df_bins   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  bin income_c_observed income_t_observed income_t_expected     0 (232.26, 380.496] 70 46 29.075391   1 (380.496, 425.324] 70 30 29.075391   2 (425.324, 456.795] 70 24 29.075391   3 (456.795, 488.83] 71 26 29.490754   4 (488.83, 513.66] 70 18 29.075391   5 (513.66, 540.048] 70 19 29.075391   6 (540.048, 576.664] 71 21 29.490754   7 (576.664, 621.022] 70 25 29.075391   8 (621.022, 682.003] 70 42 29.075391   9 (682.003, 973.46] 71 41 29.490754     We can now perform the test by comparing the expected (E) and observed (O) number of observations in the treatment group, across bins. The test statistic is given by\n$$ stat = \\sum _{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^{2}}{E_i} $$\nwhere the bins are indexed by $i$ and $O$ is the observed number of data points in bin $i$ and $E$ is the expected number of data points in bin $i$. Since we generated the bins using deciles of the distribution of income in the control group, we expect the number of observations per bin in the treatment group to be the same across bins. The test statistic is asymptocally distributed as a chi-squared distribution.\nTo compute the test statistic and the p-value of the test, we use the chisquare function from scipy.\nfrom scipy.stats import chisquare stat, p_value = chisquare(df_bins['income_t_observed'], df_bins['income_t_expected']) print(f\u0026quot;Chi-squared Test: statistic={stat:.4f}, p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)  Chi-squared Test: statistic=32.1432, p-value=0.0002  Differently from all other tests so far, the chi-squared test strongly rejects the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same. Why?\nThe reason lies in the fact that the two distributions have a similar center but different tails and the chi-squared test tests the similarity along the whole distribution and not only in the center, as we were doing with the previous tests.\nThis result tells a cautionary tale: it is very important to understand what you are actually testing before drawing blind conclusions from a p-value!\nKolmogorov-Smirnov Test The idea of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, is to compare the cumulative distributions of the two groups. In particular, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is the maximum absolute difference between the two cumulative distributions.\n$$ stat = \\sup _{x} \\ \\Big| \\ F_1(x) - F_2(x) \\ \\Big| $$\nWhere $F_1$ and $F_2$ are the two cumulative distribution functions and $x$ are the values of the underlying variable. The asymptotic distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is Kolmogorov distributed.\nTo better understand the test, let\u0026rsquo;s plot the cumulative distribution functions and the test statistic. First, we compute the cumulative distribution functions.\ndf_ks = pd.DataFrame() df_ks['Income'] = np.sort(df['Income'].unique()) df_ks['F_control'] = df_ks['Income'].apply(lambda x: np.mean(income_c\u0026lt;=x)) df_ks['F_treatment'] = df_ks['Income'].apply(lambda x: np.mean(income_t\u0026lt;=x)) df_ks.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Income F_control F_treatment     0 216.36 0.000000 0.003378   1 232.26 0.001420 0.003378   2 243.15 0.001420 0.006757   3 259.88 0.002841 0.006757   4 262.82 0.002841 0.010135     We now need to find the point where the absolute distance between the cumulative distribution functions is largest.\nk = np.argmax( np.abs(df_ks['F_control'] - df_ks['F_treatment'])) ks_stat = np.abs(df_ks['F_treatment'][k] - df_ks['F_control'][k])  We can visualize the value of the test statistic, by plotting the two cumulative distribution functions and the value of the test statistic.\ny = (df_ks['F_treatment'][k] + df_ks['F_control'][k])/2 plt.plot('Income', 'F_control', data=df_ks, label='Control') plt.plot('Income', 'F_treatment', data=df_ks, label='Treatment') plt.errorbar(x=df_ks['Income'][k], y=y, yerr=ks_stat/2, color='k', capsize=5, mew=3, label=f\u0026quot;Test statistic: {ks_stat:.4f}\u0026quot;) plt.legend(loc='center right'); plt.title(\u0026quot;Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test\u0026quot;);  From the plot, we can see that the value of the test statistic corresponds to the distance between the two cumulative distributions at income~650. For that value of income, we have the largest imbalance between the two groups.\nWe can now perform the actual test using the kstest function from scipy.\nfrom scipy.stats import kstest stat, p_value = kstest(income_t, income_c) print(f\u0026quot; Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test: statistic={stat:.4f}, p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)   Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test: statistic=0.0974, p-value=0.0355  The p-value is below 5%: we reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same, with 95% confidence.\n Note 1: The KS test is too conservative and rejects the null hypothesis too rarely. Lilliefors test corrects this bias using a different distribution for the test statistic, the Lilliefors distribution.\n  Note 2: the KS test uses very little information since it only compares the two cumulative distributions at one point: the one of maximum distance. The Anderson-Darling test and the Cramér-von Mises test instead compare the two distributions along the whole domain, by integration (the difference between the two lies in the weighting of the squared distances).\n Multiple Groups - Plots So far we have only considered the case of two groups: treatment and control. But that if we had multiple groups? Some of the methods we have seen above scale well, while others don\u0026rsquo;t.\nAs a working example, we are now going to check whether the distribution of income is the same across treatment arms.\nBoxplot The boxplot scales very well, when we have a number of groups in the single-digits, since we can put the different boxes side-by-side.\nsns.boxplot(x='Arm', y='Income', data=df.sort_values('Arm')); plt.title(\u0026quot;Boxplot, multiple groups\u0026quot;);  From the plot, it looks like the distribution of income is different across treatment arms, with higher numbered arms having a higher average income.\nViolin Plot A very nice extension of the boxplot that combines summary statistics and kernel density estimation is the violinplot. The violinplot plots separate densities along the y axis so that they don\u0026rsquo;t overlap. By default, it also adds a miniature boxplot inside.\nsns.violinplot(x='Arm', y='Income', data=df.sort_values('Arm')); plt.title(\u0026quot;Violin Plot, multiple groups\u0026quot;);  As for the boxplot, the violin plot suggests that income is different across treatment arms.\nRidgeline Plot Lastly, the ridgeline plot plots multiple kernel density distributions along the x-axis, making them more intuitive than the violin plot but partially overlapping them. Unfortunately, there is no default ridgeline plot neither in matplotlib nor in seaborn. We need to import it from joypy.\nfrom joypy import joyplot joyplot(df, by='Arm', column='Income', colormap=sns.color_palette(\u0026quot;crest\u0026quot;, as_cmap=True)); plt.xlabel('Income'); plt.title(\u0026quot;Ridgeline Plot, multiple groups\u0026quot;);  Again, the ridgeline plot suggests that higher numbered treatment arms have higher income. From this plot it is also easier to appreciate the different shapes of the distributions.\nMultiple Groups - Tests Lastly, let\u0026rsquo;s consider hypothesis tests to compare multiple groups. For simplicity, we will concentrate on the most popular one: the F-test.\nF-test With multiple groups, the most popular test is the F-test. The F-test compares the variance of a variable across different groups. This analysis is also called analysis of variance, or ANOVA.\nIn practice, the F-test statistic is\n$$ \\text{stat} = \\frac{\\text{between-group variance}}{\\text{within-group variance}} = \\frac{\\sum_{g} \\big( \\bar x_g - \\bar x \\big) / (G-1)}{\\sum_{g} \\sum_{i \\in g} \\big( \\bar x_i - \\bar x_g \\big) / (N-G)} $$\nWhere $G$ is the number of groups, $N$ is the number of observations, $\\bar x$ is the overall mean and $\\bar x_g$ is the mean within group $g$. Under the null hypothesis of group independence, the f-statistic is F-distributed.\nfrom scipy.stats import f_oneway income_groups = [df.loc[df['Arm']==arm, 'Income'].values for arm in df['Arm'].dropna().unique()] stat, p_value = f_oneway(*income_groups) print(f\u0026quot;F Test: statistic={stat:.4f}, p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)  F Test: statistic=9.0911, p-value=0.0000  The test p-value is basically zero, implying a strong rejection of the null hypothesis of no differences in the income distribution across treatment arms.\nConclusion In this post we have see a ton of different ways to compare two or more distributions, both visually and statistically. This is a primary concern in many applications, but especially in causal inference where we use randomization to make treatment and control group as comparable as possible.\nWe have also seen how different methods might be better suited for different situations. Visual methods are great to build intuition, but statistical methods are essential for decision-making, since we need to be able to assess the magnitude and statistical significance of the differences.\nReferences [1] Student, The Probable Error of a Mean (1908), Biometrika.\n[2] F.

For example, we might want to test alternative UX designs, or drugs, or policies. Depending on the context, there might be many reasons why we want to test different treatments at the same time, but generally it can help reducing the sample size, as we need just a single control group. A simple way to recover the different treatment effects is a linear regression of the outcome of interest on the different treatment indicators.\nHowever, in causal inference, we often condition the analysis on other observable variables (often called control variables), either to increase power or, especially in quasi-experimental settings, to identify a causal parameter instead of a simple correlation. There are cases in which adding control variables can backfire, but otherwise, we usually think that the regression framework is still able to recover the average treatment effect.\nIn a breakthrough paper, Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hull and Kolesár (2022) have recently shown that in case of multiple and mutually-exclusive treatments with control variables, the regression coefficients do not identify a causal effect. However, not everything is lost: the authors propose a simple solution to this problem that still makes use of linear regression.\nIn this blog post, I am going to go through a simple example illustrating the nature of the problem and the solution proposed by the authors.\nMultiple Treatments Example Suppose we are an online store and we are not satisfied with our current checkout page. In particular, we would like to change our checkout button to increase the probability of a purchase. Our UX designer comes up with two alternative checkout buttons, which are displayed below.\nIn order to understand which button to use, we run an A/B test, or randomized control trial. In particular, when people arrive at the checkout page, we show them one of the three options, at random. Then, for each user, we record the revenue generated which is our outcome of interest.\nI generate a synthetic dataset using dgp_buttons() from src.dgp as data generating process. I also import plotting functions and standard libraries from src.utils.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_buttons  dgp = dgp_buttons() df = dgp.generate_data() df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  group revenue mobile     0 button1 8.927335 0   1 default 13.613456 1   2 button2 4.777628 0   3 default 8.909049 0   4 default 10.160347 0     We have information on 2000 users, for which we observe their checkout button (default, button1 or button2), the revenue they generate and whether they connected from desktop or mobile.\nWe notice too late that we have a problem with randomization. We showed button1 more frequently to desktop users and button2 more frequently to mobile users. The control group that sees the default button instead is balanced.\nWhat should we do? What happens if we simply compare revenue across groups? Let\u0026rsquo;s do it by regressing revenue on group dummy variables.\nsmf.ols('revenue ~ group', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  11.6553  0.149  78.250  0.000  11.363  11.948   group[T.button1]  -0.5802  0.227  -2.556  0.011  -1.026  -0.135   group[T.button2]  -0.5958  0.218  -2.727  0.006  -1.024  -0.167   From the regression results we estimate a negative and significant effect for both buttons. Should we believe these estimates? Are they causal?\nIt is unlikely that what we have estimated are the true treatment effects. In fact, there might be substantial differences in purchase attitudes between desktop and mobile users. Since we do not have a comparable number of mobile and desktop users across treatment arms, it might be that the observed differences in revenue are due to the device used and not the button design.\nBecause of this, we decide to condition our analysis on the device used and we include the mobile dummy variable in the regression.\nsmf.ols('revenue ~ group + mobile', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  9.1414  0.110  82.905  0.000  8.925  9.358   group[T.button1]  0.3609  0.141  2.558  0.011  0.084  0.638   group[T.button2]  -1.0326  0.134  -7.684  0.000  -1.296  -0.769   mobile  4.7181  0.116  40.691  0.000  4.491  4.946   Now the coefficient of button1 is positive and significant. Should we recommend its implementation?\nThe answer is surprisingly no. Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hull, Kolesár (2022) show that this type of regression does not identify the average treatment effect when:\n there are mutually exclusive treatment arms (in our case, groups) we are controlling for some variable $X$ (in our case, mobile) there treatment effects are heterogeneous in $X$  This is true even if the treatment is \u0026ldquo;as good as random\u0026rdquo; once we condition on $X$.\nIndeed, in our case, the true treatment effects are the ones reported in the following table.\nThe first button has no effect on revenue, irrespectively of the device, while the second button has a positive effect for mobile users and a negative effect for desktop users. Our (wrong) regression specification instead estimates a positive effect of the first button.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now dig more in detail into the math, to understand why this is happening.\nTheory This section borrows heavily from Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hull, Kolesár (2022). For a great summary of the paper, I recommend this excellent Twitter thread by one of the authors, Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham.\nEconomists love using linear regression to estimate treatment effects — it turns out that there are perils to this method, but also amazing perks\nCome with me in this 🧵 if you want to learn… https://t.co/eDsRLkZFZe\n\u0026mdash; Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham (@paulgp) June 7, 2022  Single Treatment Arm Suppose we are interested in the effect of a treatment $D$ on an outcome $Y$. First, let\u0026rsquo;s consider the standard case of a single treatment arm so that the treatment variable is binary, $D \\in \\lbrace 0 , 1 \\rbrace$. Also consider a single binary control variable $X \\in \\lbrace 0 , 1 \\rbrace$. We also assume that treatment assignment is as good as random, conditionally on $X$. This means that there might be systematic differences between the treatment and control group, however, these differences are fully accounted for by $X$. Formally we write\n$$ \\left( Y_i^{(0)}, Y_i^{(1)} \\right) \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ X_i $$\nWhere $Y_i^{(d)}$ denotes the potential outcome of individual $i$ when its treatment status is $d$. For example, $Y_i^{(0)}$ indicates the outcome of individual $i$ in case it is not treated. This notation comes from Rubin\u0026rsquo;s potential outcomes framework. We can write the individual treatment effect of individual $i$ as\n$$ \\tau_i = Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)} $$\nIn this setting, the regression of interest is\n$$ Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta D_i + \\gamma X_i + u_i $$\nThe coefficient of interest is $\\beta$.\nAngrist (1998) shows that the regression coefficient $\\beta$ identifies the average treatment effect. In particular, $\\beta$ identifies a weighted average of the within-group $x$ average treatment effect $\\tau (x)$ with convex weights. In this particular setting, we can write it as\n$$ \\beta = \\lambda \\tau(0) + (1 - \\lambda) \\tau(1) \\qquad \\text{where} \\qquad \\tau (x) = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)} \\ \\big| \\ X_i = x \\big] $$\nThe weights $\\lambda$ and $(1-\\lambda)$ are given by the within-group treatment variance. Hence, the OLS estimator gives less weight to groups where we have less treatment variance, i.e., where treatment is more imbalanced. Groups where treatment is distributed 50-50 get the most weight.\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{ \\text{Var} \\big(D_i \\ \\big| \\ X_i = 0 \\big) \\Pr \\big(X_i=0 \\big)}{\\sum_{x \\in \\lbrace 0 , 1 \\rbrace} \\text{Var} \\big(D_i \\ \\big| \\ X_i = x \\big) \\Pr \\big( X_i=x \\big)} \\in [0, 1] $$\nThe weights can be derived using the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem to express $\\beta_1$ as the OLS coefficient of a univariate regression of $Y$ on $D_{i, \\perp X}$, where $D_{i, \\perp X}$ are the residuals from regressing $D$ on $X$. If you are not familiar with the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem, I wrote an introductory blog post here.\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i, \\perp X} Y_i \\big] }{ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i, \\perp X}^2 \\big] } = \\underbrace{ \\frac{\\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i, \\perp X} Y_i(0) \\big]}{\\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i, \\perp X}^2 \\big]} } _ {=0} + \\frac{\\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i, \\perp X} D_i \\tau_i \\big]}{\\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i, \\perp X}^2 \\big]} = \\frac{\\mathbb E \\big[ \\text{Var} (D_i | X_i) \\ \\tau(X_i) \\big]}{\\mathbb E \\big[ \\text{Var}(D_i | X_i) \\big]} $$\nThe second term of the central expression disappears because the residual $D_{i, \\perp X}$ is by construction mean independent of the control variable $X_i$, i.e.\n$$ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i, \\perp X} | X_i \\big] = 0 $$\nThis mean independence property is crucial to obtain an unbiased estimate and its failure in the multiple-treatment case is the source of the contamination bias.\nMultiple Treatment Arms Let\u0026rsquo;s now consider the case of multiple treatment arms, $D \\in \\lbrace 0, 1, 2 \\rbrace$, where $1$ and $2$ indicate two mutually-exclusive treatments. We still assume conditional ignorability, i.e., treatment assignment is as good as random, conditional on $X$.\n$$ \\left( Y_i^{(0)}, Y_i^{(1)}, Y_i^{(2)} \\right) \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ X_i $$\nIn this case, we have two different individual treatment effects, one per treatment.\n$$ \\tau_{i1} = Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)} \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\tau_{i2} = Y_i^{(2)} - Y_i^{(0)} $$\nThe regression of interest is\n$$ Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1 D_{i1} + \\beta_2 D_{i2} + \\gamma X_i + u_i $$\nDoes the OLS estimator of $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ identify an average treatment effect?\nIt would be very tempting to say yes. In fact, it looks like not much has changed with respect to the previous setup. We just have one extra treatment, but the potential outcomes are still conditionally independent of it. Where is the issue?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s concentrate on $\\beta_1$ (the same applies to $\\beta_2$). As before, can rewrite $\\beta_1$ using the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem as the OLS coefficient of a univariate regression of $Y_i$ on $D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2}$, where $D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2}$ are the residuals from regressing $D_1$ on $D_2$ and $X$.\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{ \\mathbb E \\big[D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2} Y_i \\big] }{ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2}^2 \\big]} = \\underbrace{ \\frac{ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2} Y_i(0) \\big] }{\\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2}^2 \\big]} } _ {=0} + \\frac{ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2} D_{i1} \\tau_{i1} \\big] }{ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2}^2 \\big]} + \\color{red}{ \\underbrace{ \\color{black}{ \\frac{ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2} D_{i2} \\tau_{i2} \\big] }{ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2}^2 \\big]}} } _ { \\neq 0} } $$\nThe problem is the last term. Without the last term, we could still write $\\beta_1$ as a convex combination of the individual treatment effects. However, the last term biases the estimator by adding a component that depends on the treatment effect of $D_2$, $\\tau_2$. Why does this term not disappear?\nThe problem is that $D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2}$ is not mean independent of $D_{i2}$, i.e.\n$$ \\mathbb E \\big[ D_{i1, \\perp X, D_2} D_{i2} \\ \\big| \\ X_i \\big] \\neq 0 $$\nThe reason lies in the fact that the treatments are mutually exclusive. This implies that when $D_{i1}=1$, $D_{i2}$ must be zero, regardless of the value of $X_i$. Therefore, the last term does not cancel out and it introduces a contamination bias.\nSolution Goldsmith-Pinkham, Hull, Kolesár (2022) show that a simple estimator, first proposed by Imbens and Wooldridge (2009), is able to remove the bias. The procedure is the following.\n De-mean the control variable: $\\tilde X = X - \\bar X$ Regress $Y$ on the interaction between the treatment indicators $D$ and the demeaned control variable $\\tilde X$  The OLS estimators of $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are unbiased estimators of the average treatment effects. It also just requires a linear regression. Moreover, this estimator is unbiased also for continuous control variables $X$, not only for a binary one as we have considered so far.\nWhy was this estimator initially proposed by Imbens and Wooldridge (2009)? Let\u0026rsquo;s analyze two parts separately: the interaction term between $D$ and $X$ and the fact that $X$ is de-meaned in the interaction term.\nFirst, the interaction term $D X$ allows us to control for different effects and/or distributions of $X$ across treatment and control group.\nSecond, de-meaning $X$ in the interaction term allows us to interpret the estimated coefficient $\\hat \\beta$ as the average treatment effect. In fact, assume we were estimating the following linear model, where $X$ is not de-meaned in the interaction term.\n$$ Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta D_i + \\gamma X_i + \\delta D_i X_i + u_i $$\nIn this case, the marginal effect of $D$ on $Y$ is $\\beta + \\delta X_i$ so that the average marginal effect is $\\beta + \\delta \\bar X$ which is different from $\\beta$.\nIf instead we use the de-meaned value of $X$ in the interaction term, the marginal effect of $D$ on $Y$ is $\\beta + \\delta (X_i - \\bar X)$ so that the average marginal effect is $\\beta + \\delta (\\bar X - \\bar X) = \\beta$. Now we can interpret $\\beta$ as the average marginal effect of $D$ on $Y$.\nSimulations In order to better understand both the problem and the solution, let\u0026rsquo;s run some simulations.\nWe run an estimator over different draws from the data generating process dgp_buttons(). This is only possible with synthetic data and we do not have this luxury in reality. For each sample, we record the estimated coefficient and the corresponding p-value.\ndef simulate(dgp, estimator, K=1000): # Initialize coefficients results = pd.DataFrame({'Coefficient': np.zeros(K), 'pvalue': np.zeros(K)}) # Compute coefficients for k in range(K): df = dgp.generate_data(seed=k) results.Coefficient[k] = estimator(df).params[1] results.pvalue[k] = estimator(df).pvalues[1] results['Significant'] = results['pvalue'] \u0026lt; 0.05 return results  First, let\u0026rsquo;s try it with the old estimator that regresses revenue on both group and mobile dummy variables.\nols_estimator = lambda x: smf.ols('revenue ~ group + mobile', data=x).fit() results = simulate(dgp, ols_estimator)  I plot the distribution of the coefficient estimates of button1 over 1000 simulations, highlighting the statistically significant ones at the 5% level. I also highlight the true value of the coefficient, zero, with a vertical dotted bar.\ndef plot_results(results): p_sig = sum(results['Significant']) / len(results) * 100 sns.histplot(data=results, x=\u0026quot;Coefficient\u0026quot;, hue=\u0026quot;Significant\u0026quot;, multiple=\u0026quot;stack\u0026quot;, palette = ['tab:red', 'tab:green']); plt.axvline(x=0, c='k', ls='--', label='truth') plt.title(rf\u0026quot;Estimated $\\beta_1$ ({p_sig:.0f}% significant)\u0026quot;);  plot_results(results)  As we can see, we reject the null hypothesis of no effect of button1 in 45% of the simulations. Since we set a confidence level of 5%, we would have expected at most around 5% of rejections. Our estimator is biased.\nAs we have seen above, the problem is that the estimator is not just a convex combination of the effect of button1 across mobile and desktop users (it\u0026rsquo;s zero for both), but it is contaminated by the effect of button2.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s now try the estimator proposed from Imbens and Wooldridge (2009). First, we need do de-mean our control variable, mobile. Then, we regress revenue on the interaction between group and the de-meaned control variable, res_mobile.\ndf['mobile_res'] = df['mobile'] - np.mean(df['mobile']) smf.ols('revenue ~ group * mobile_res', data=df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  11.5773  0.067  172.864  0.000  11.446  11.709   group[T.button1]  0.0281  0.106  0.266  0.790  -0.180  0.236   group[T.button2]  -1.5071  0.100  -15.112  0.000  -1.703  -1.311   mobile_res  2.9107  0.134  21.715  0.000  2.648  3.174   group[T.button1]:mobile_res  0.1605  0.211  0.760  0.448  -0.254  0.575   group[T.button2]:mobile_res  5.3771  0.200  26.905  0.000  4.985  5.769   The estimated coefficients are now close to their true values. The estimated coefficient for button1 is not significant, while the estimated coefficient for button2 is negative and significant.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check whether this results holds across samples by running a simulation. We repeat the estimation procedure 1000 times and we plot the distribution of estimated coefficients for button1.\nnew_estimator = lambda x: smf.ols('revenue ~ group * mobile', data=x).fit() new_results = simulate(dgp, new_estimator)  plot_results(new_results)  Now the distribution of the estimated coefficient for button1 is centered around the true value of zero. Moreover, we reject the null hypothesis of no effect only in 1% of the simulations, consistently with the chosen confidence level of 95%.\nConclusion In this post, we have seen the dangers of running a factor regression model with multiple mutually exclusive treatment arms and treatment effect heterogeneity across a control variable. In this case, because the treatments are not independent, the regression coefficients are not a convex combination of the within-group average treatment effects, but also capture the treatment effects of the other treatments introducing contamination bias. The solution to the problem is both simple and elegant, requiring just a linear regression.\nHowever, the problem is more general than this setting and generally concerns every setting in which (all of the following)\n We have multiple treatments that depend on each other We need to condition the analysis on a control variable The treatment effects are heterogeneous in the control variable  Another popular example is the case of the Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) estimator with staggered treatments.\nReferences [1] J.

The answer for me is, not often since high-school, but recently they popped up again in data science interviews.\nDespite countless classes in statistics, I still take a deep breath and hope I won\u0026rsquo;t embarrass myself too much. My main problem is that I get crazy confused with binary labels, especially if the label itself is not too intuitive.\nSome non-intuitive (for me) binary labels include:\n sine and cosine concavity and convexity precision and recall type 1 and type 2 error rate  And last but not least, combinations and permutations.\nSo this blog post is an attempt to clarify once and for all the difference between the two and get some practice.\nThe Math Permutations vs Combinations The main difference between combinations and permutations is order. In particular:\n Permutations: order matters Combinations: order does not matter  What does it mean in practice?\nOne rule of thumb is to check whether the individual objects are identifiable. For example:\n Urn with blue and red balls: the individual ball is not identifiable, therefore we are talking about combinations Deck of cards: individual cards are identifiable, therefore it could be either way  Also, note that for any problem, the number of permutations is always weakly larger than the number of combinations. The intuition is simple: since in permutations order matters, AB and BA are two different outcomes, while with combinations they are grouped into a single one.\nExample\nFor this section, we are going to use a simple example in which we have to order a two-scoops ice cream cone and there are three possible flavors: amarena, chocolate and pistacchio.\nPermutations Let\u0026rsquo;s start with permutations since they are mathematically simpler. We have seen that in combinations order matters. In our example, suppose we care about which flavor is on top on the ice cream. Now we are going to further distinguish between two cases:\n With replacement Without replacement  Where replacement means that after I draw an object, I can draw it again (e.g. I put it back in the pool).\nReplacement\nIn the first case, we can order both scoops of the same flavor. Therefore, for each scoop (2) we have 3 options (the flavors).\nThe number of overall events is\n$$ \\text{from 3 permute 2, with replacement} = 3 * 3 = 3^2 = 9 $$\nIn general, the number of possible permutations of $n$ objects in $k$ draws with replacement is $n^k$.\nNo Replacement\nAlternatively, we can only order different flavors in each scoop. In this case, for the first scoop we can pick any flavor, but for the second scoop we can only pick one of the two remaining flavors.\nThe number of overall events is\n$$ \\text{from 3 permute 2, without replacement} = 3 * 2 = \\frac{3!}{(3-2)!} = \\frac{3 * 2 * 1}{1} = 6 $$\nwhere ! denotes the factorial operation which can be recursively defined as $n! = n \\times (n-1)!$ with $0! = 1$.\nIn general, the number of possible permutations of $n$ objects in $k$ draws without replacement is $\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.\nCombinations Combinations are usually more common since in a lot of scenarios we do not care about the order or the identity of the objects. In our example, let\u0026rsquo;s assume we don\u0026rsquo;t care which flavor gets on top. As before, we are going to further distinguish between two cases:\n With replacement Without replacement  No Replacement\nIn this case, we cannot have two scoops of the same flavor. Therefore, for each scoop (2) we have 3 options (the flavors). However, the order of the flavors does not matter, i.e. we are indifferent between getting chocolate on top or on the bottom, as long as we get it.\nThe number of overall events therefore is the number of permutations of 3 flavors among 2 scoops, divided by the permutations of 2 out of 2 scoops.\n$$ \\text{from 3 choose 2, without replacement} = \\frac{\\text{from 3 permute 2, without replacement}}{\\text{from 2 permute 2, without replacement}} = \\frac{\\frac{3!}{(3-2)!}}{\\frac{2!}{(2-2)!}} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3 * 2 * 1}{2 * 1 * 1} = 3 $$\nIn general, we define the mathematical operation \u0026ldquo;from $n$ choose $k$\u0026rdquo; as\n$$ \\text{from n choose k} := {n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nWhich corresponds to the number of possible combinations of $n$ objects in $k$ draws without replacement.\nReplacement\nAlternatively, we can be allowed to order the same flavor for both scoops.\nIn this case, the number of overall events is\n$$ \\text{from 3 choose 2, with replacement} = {3 + 2 - 1 \\choose 2} = \\frac{(3 + 2 - 1)!}{2!(3-1)!} = \\frac{4 * 3 * 2 * 1}{2 * 1 * 2 * 1} = 6 $$\nIn general, the number of possible combinations of $n$ objects in $k$ draws with replacement is ${n + k - 1 \\choose k}$.\nSummary We can summarize all the possible scenarios in a simple table.\n    With Replacement Without Replacement     Permutations (order matters): $n^k$ $\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} $   Combinations (order doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter): $ {n + k - 1 \\choose k} \\text{=}\\frac{(n+k-1)!}{(n-1)!k!} $ $ {n \\choose k} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!} $    Where $n$ is the number of objects and $k$ is the number of draws.\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s explore together a more complex example to see how we can apply permutations and combinations to compute probabilities.\n There are four people in an elevator, four floors in the building, and each person exits at random. Find the probability that:\n all people exit at different floors all people exit at the same floor two get off at one floor and two get off at another   I use the factorial and comb functions from the math library.\nfrom math import factorial, comb  Practical Advice Before we start, some practical advice. What worked best for me is to approach the question in the following way:\n what are the overall events that we are considering? what are the positive events that we are considering?  And for both questions, I ask myself:\n does order matter? is there replacement?  Moreover, it is also very useful to restate the problem in terms of objects and draws. For example, in this case, I can restate the problem as: \u0026ldquo;I am drawing a floor for each person\u0026rdquo;. This makes it clear whether or not there is replacement, i.e. whether or not I can draw the same floor for different persons.\nQuestion 1  What is the probability that they all get off at different floors?\n Total events: (from floors 4 permute 4, with replacement)\nPositive events: (from floors 4 permute 4, without replacement)\nfactorial(4) / 4**4  0.09375  Question 2  What is the probability that they all exit at the same floor?\n Total events: (from 4 floors permute 4, with replacement)\nPositive events: (from floors 4 choose 1)\n4 / 4**4  0.015625  Question 3  What is the probability that two get off at one floor and two at another?\n Total events: (from floors 4 permute 4, with replacement)\nPositive events: (from 4 people choose 2, without replacement) * (from 4 floors choose 2, without replacement)\ncomb(4, 2) * comb(4, 2) / 4**4  0.140625  Practice Questions Now it\u0026rsquo;s your time to shine!

One possibility is to regress the latter on the former, using the following regression model, also called the short model.\n$$ \\text{sales} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{ads} + \\varepsilon $$\nShould we also include past sales in the regression? Then the regression model would be the following, also called long model.\n$$ \\text{sales} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{ads} + \\beta \\cdot \\text{past sales} + \\varepsilon $$\nOne naive approach would be to let the data decide: we could run the second regression and, if the effect of past sales, $\\beta$, is statistically significant, we are good with the long model, otherwise we run the short model. This procedure is called pre-testing.\nThe problem with this procedure is that it introduces a bias that is called regularization or pre-test bias. Pre-testing ensures that this bias is small enough not to distort the estimated coefficient. However, it does not ensure that it is small enough not to distort the confidence intervals around the estimated coefficient.\nIs there a solution? Yes!\nPost-Double Selection The solution is called post-double selection. The method was first introduced in Belloni, Chernozhukov, Hansen (2014) and later expanded in a variety of papers.\nThe authors assume the following data generating process:\n$$ y = \\alpha D + \\beta X + u \\newline D = \\delta X + v $$\nIn our example, $Y$ corresponds to sales, $D$ corresponds to ads, $X$ corresponds to past_sales and the effect of interest is $\\alpha$. In our example, $X$ is 1-dimensional for simplicity, but generally we are interested in cases where X is high-dimensional, potentially even having more dimensions than the number of observations. In that case, variable selection is essential in linear regression since we cannot have more features than variables (the OLS coefficients are not uniquely determined anymore).\nPost-double selection consists in the following procedure.\n Reduced Form selection: lasso $Y$ on $X$. Select the statistically significant variables in the set $S_{RF} \\subseteq X$ First Stage selection: regress $D$ on $X$. Select the statistically significant variables in the set $S_{FS} \\subseteq X$ Regress $Y$ on $D$ and the union of the selected variables in the first two steps, $S_{FS} \\cup S_{RF}$  The authors show that this procedure produces confidence intervals for the coefficient of interest $\\alpha$ that have the correct coverage, i.e. the correct probability of type 1 error.\nNote (1): this procedure is always less parsimonious, in terms of variable selection, than pre-testing. In fact, we still select all the variables we would have selected with pre-testing but, in the first stage, we might select additional variables.\nNote (2): the terms first stage and reduced form come from the intrumental variables literature in econometrics. Indeed, the first application of post-double selection was to select instrumental variables in Belloni, Chen, Chernozhukov, Hansen (2012).\nNote (3): the name post-double selection comes from the fact that now we are not performing variable selection once but twice.\nIntuition The idea behind post-double selection is: bound the omitted variables bias. In case you are not familiar with it, I wrote a separate blog post on omitted variable bias.\nIn our setting, we can express the omitted variable bias as\n$$ \\text{OVB} = \\beta \\delta \\qquad \\text{ where } \\qquad \\beta := \\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{Var(X)}, \\quad \\delta := \\frac{Cov(D, X)}{Var(D)} $$\nAs we can see, the omitted variable bias comes from the product of two quantities related to the omitted variable $X$:\n Its partial correlation with the outcome $Y$, $\\beta$ Its partial correlation with the variable of interest $D$, $\\delta$  With pre-testing, we ensure that the partial correlation between $X$ the outcome $Y$, $\\beta$, is small. In fact, we omit $Z$ when we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t (i.e. we commit a type 2 error) rarely. What do small and rarely mean?\nWhen we are selecting a variable because of its significance, we ensure that it dimension is smaller than $\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$ for some number $c$, where $n$ is the sample size.\nTherefore, with pre-testing, we ensure that, no matter what the value of $\\delta$ is, the dimension of the bias is smaller than $\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$ which means that it converges to zero for sufficiently large $n$. This is why the pre-testing estimator is still consistent.\nHowever, in order for our confidence intervals to have the right coverage, this is not enough. In practice, we need the bias to converge to zero faster than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$. Why?\nTo get an intuition for this result, we need to turn to the Central Limit Theorem. The CLT tells us that for large $n$ the distribution of the sample average of a random variable $X$ converges to a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, where $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are the mean and standard deviation of $X$. To do inference, we usually apply the Central Limit Theorem to our estimator to get its asymptotic distribution, which in turn allows us to build confidence intervals (using the mean and the standard deviation). Therefore, if the bias is not sensibly smaller than the standard deviation of the estimator, the confidence intervals are going to be wrong. Therefore, we need the bias to converge to zero faster than the standard deviation, i.e. faster than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\nIn our setting, the omitted variable bias is $\\beta \\gamma$ and we want it to converge to zero faster than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$. Post-double selection guarantees that\n Reduced form selection (pre-testing): any \u0026ldquo;missing\u0026rdquo; variable $j$ has $|\\beta_j| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$ First stage selection (additional): any \u0026ldquo;missing\u0026rdquo; variable $j$ has $|\\delta_j| \\leq \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}$  As a consequence, as long as the number of omitted variables is finite, the omitted variable bias is going to converge to zero at a rate $\\frac{1}{n}$, which is faster than $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$. Problem solved!\nApplication Let\u0026rsquo;s now go back to our example and test the post-double selection procedure. In practice, we want to do the following:\n First Stage selection: regress ads on past_sales. Check if past_sales is statistically significant Reduced Form selection: regress sales on past_sales. Check if past_sales is statistically significant Regress sales on ads and include past_sales only if it was significant in either one of the two previous regressions  I update the pre_test function from the first part of the post to compute also the post-double selection estimator.\ndef pre_test(d='ads', y='sales', x='past_sales', K=1000, **kwargs): # Init alphas = pd.DataFrame({'Long': np.zeros(K), 'Short': np.zeros(K), 'Pre-test': np.zeros(K), 'Post-double': np.zeros(K)}) # Loop over simulations for k in range(K): # Generate data df = dgp_pretest().generate_data(seed=k, **kwargs) # Compute coefficients alphas['Long'][k] = smf.ols(f'{y} ~ {d} + {x}', df).fit().params[1] alphas['Short'][k] = smf.ols(f'{y} ~ {d}', df).fit().params[1] # Compute significance of beta and gamma p_value_ydx = smf.ols(f'{y} ~ {d} + {x}', df).fit().pvalues[2] p_value_yx = smf.ols(f'{y} ~ {x}', df).fit().pvalues[1] p_value_dx = smf.ols(f'{d} ~ {x}', df).fit().pvalues[1] # Select pre-test specification based on regression of y on d and x if p_value_ydx\u0026lt;0.05: alphas['Pre-test'][k] = alphas['Long'][k] else: alphas['Pre-test'][k] = alphas['Short'][k] # Select post-double specification based on regression of y on d and x if p_value_yx\u0026lt;0.05 or p_value_dx\u0026lt;0.05: alphas['Post-double'][k] = alphas['Long'][k] else: alphas['Post-double'][k] = alphas['Short'][k] return alphas  alphas = pre_test()  We can now plot the distributions (over simulations) of the estimated coefficients.\ndef plot_alphas(alphas, true_alpha): # Init plot K = len(alphas.columns) fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, K, figsize=(4*K, 5), sharey=True, sharex=True) # Make one plot for each set of coefficients for i, key in enumerate(alphas.columns): axes[i].hist(alphas[key].values, bins=30, lw=.1, color=f'C{int(i==3)*2}') axes[i].set_title(key) axes[i].axvline(true_alpha, c='r', ls='--') legend_text = [rf'$\\alpha=${true_alpha}', rf'$\\hat \\alpha=${np.mean(alphas[key]):.4f}'] axes[i].legend(legend_text, prop={'size': 10}, loc='upper right')  plot_alphas(alphas, true_alpha=1)  As we can see, the post-double selection estimator always correctly selects the long regression and therefore has the correct distribution.\nDouble-checks In the last post, we ran some simulations in order to investigate when pre-testing bias emerges. We saw that pre-testing is a problem for\n Small sample sizes $n$ Intermediate values of $\\beta$ When the value of $\\beta$ depends on the sample size  Let\u0026rsquo;s check that post-double selection removes regularization bias in all the previous cases.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s simulate the distribution of the post-double selection estimator $\\hat \\alpha_{postdouble}$ for different sample sizes.\nNs = [100,300,1000,3000] alphas = {f'N = {n:.0f}': pre_test(N=n) for n in Ns}  def compare_alphas(alphas, true_alpha): # Init plot fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(alphas), figsize=(4*len(alphas), 5), sharey=True, sharex=True) # Make one plot for each set of coefficients for i, key in enumerate(alphas.keys()): axes[i].hist(alphas[key]['Pre-test'], bins=30, lw=.1, alpha=0.5) axes[i].hist(alphas[key]['Post-double'], bins=30, lw=.1, alpha=0.5, color='C2') axes[i].set_title(key) axes[i].axvline(true_alpha, c='r', ls='--') axes[i].legend([rf'$\\alpha=${true_alpha}', 'Pre-test', 'Post-double'], prop={'size': 10}, loc='upper right')  compare_alphas(alphas, true_alpha=1)  For small samples, the distribution of the pre-testing estimator is not normal but rather bimodal. From the plots we can see that the post-double estimator is gaussian also in small sample sizes.\nNow we repeat the same exercise, but for different values of $\\beta$, the coefficient of past_sales on sales.\nbetas = 0.3 * np.array([0.1,0.3,1,3]) alphas = {f'beta = {b:.2f}': pre_test(b=b) for b in betas} compare_alphas(alphas, true_alpha=1)  Again, the post-double selection estimator has a gaussian distribution irrespectively of the value of $\\beta$, while he pre-testing estimator suffers from regularization bias.\nFor the last simulation, we change both the coefficient and the sample size at the same time.\nbetas = 0.3 * 30 / np.sqrt(Ns) alphas = {f'N = {n:.0f}': pre_test(b=b, N=n) for n,b in zip(Ns,betas)} compare_alphas(alphas, true_alpha=1)  Also in this last case, the post-double selection estimator performs well and inference is not distorted.\nDouble Debiased Machine Learning So far, we only have analyzed a linear, univariate example. What happens if the dimension of $X$ increases and we do not know the functional form through which $X$ affects $Y$ and $D$? In these cases, we can use machine learning algorithms to uncover these high-dimensional non-linear relationships.\nChernozhukov, Chetverikov, Demirer, Duflo, Hansen, Newey, and Robins (2018) investigate this setting. In particular, the authors consider the following partially linear model.\n$$ Y = \\alpha D + g(X) + u \\ D = m(X) + v $$\nwhere $Y$ is the outcome variable, $D$ is the treatment to interest and $X$ is a potentially high-dimensional set of control variables.\nNaive approach A naive approach to estimation of $\\alpha$ using machine learning methods would be, for example, to construct a sophisticated machine learning estimator for learning the regression function $\\alpha D$ + $g(X)$.\n Split the sample in two: main sample and auxiliary sample [why? see note below] Use the auxiliary sample to estimate $\\hat g(X)$ Use the main sample to compute the orthogonalized component of $Y$ on $X$: $\\ \\hat u = Y - \\hat{g} (X)$ Use the main sample to estimate the residualized OLS estimator from regressing $\\hat u$ on $D$  $$ \\hat \\alpha = \\left( D' D \\right) ^{-1} D' \\hat u $$\nThis estimator is going to have two problems:\n Slow rate of convergence, i.e. slower than $\\sqrt(n)$ It will be biased because we are employing high dimensional regularized estimators (e.g. we are doing variable selection)  Note (1): so far we have not talked about it, but variable selection procedure also introduce another type of bias: overfitting bias. This bias emerges because of the fact that the sample used to select the variables is the same that is used to estimate the coefficient of interest. This bias is easily accounted for with sample splitting: using different sub-samples for the selection and the estimation procedures.\nNote (2): why can we use the residuals from step 3 to estimate $\\alpha$ in step 4? Because of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem. If you are not familiar with it, I have written a blog post on the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem here.\nOrthogonalization Now consider a second construction that employs an orthogonalized formulation obtained by directly partialling out the effect of $X$ from $D$ to obtain the orthogonalized regressor $v = D − m(X)$.\n  Split the sample in two: main sample and auxiliary sample\n  Use the auxiliary sample to estimate $\\hat g(X)$ from\n$$ Y = \\alpha D + g(X) + u \\ $$\n  Use the auxiliary sample to estimate $\\hat m(X)$ from\n$$ D = m(X) + v $$\n  Use the main sample to compute the orthogonalized component of $D$ on $X$ as\n$$ \\hat v = D - \\hat m(X) $$\n  Use the main sample to estimate the double-residualized OLS estimator as\n$$ \\hat \\alpha = \\left( \\hat{v}' D \\right) ^{-1} \\hat{v}' \\left( Y - \\hat g(X) \\right) $$\n  The estimator is root-N consistent! This means that not only the estimator converges to the true value as the sample sizes increases (i.e. it\u0026rsquo;s consistent), but also its standard deviation does (i.e. it\u0026rsquo;s root-N consistent).\nHowever, the estimator still has a lower rate of convergence because of sample splitting. The problem is solved by inverting the split sample, re-estimating the coefficient and averaging the two estimates. Note that this procedure is valid since the two estimates are independent by the sample splitting procedure.\nA Cautionary Tale Before we conclude, I have to mention a recent research paper by Hünermund, Louw, and Caspi (2022), in which the authors show that double-debiased machine learning can easily backfire, if we apply blindly.\nThe problem is related to bad control variables. If you have never heard this term, I have written an introductory blog post on good and bad control variables here. In short, conditioning the analysis on additional features is not always good for causal inference. Depending on the setting, there might exist variables that we want to leave out of our analysis since their inclusion can bias the coefficient of interest, preventing a causal interpretation. The simplest example is variables that are common outcomes, of both the treatment $D$ and outcome variable $Y$.\nThe double-debiased machine learning model implicitly assumes that the control variables $X$ are (weakly) common causes to both the outcome $Y$ and the treatment $D$. If this is the case, and no further mediated/indirect relationship exists between $X$ and $Y$, there is no problem. However, if, for example, some variable among the controls $X$ is a common effect instead of a common cause, its inclusion will bias the coefficient of interest. Moreover, this variable is likely to be highly correlated either with the outcome $Y$ or with the treatment $D$. In the latter case, this implies that post-double selection might include it in cases in which simple selection would have not. Therefore, in presence of bad control variables, doule-debiased machine learning might be even worse than simple pre-testing.\nIn short, as for any method, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the method\u0026rsquo;s assumptions and to always check for potential violations.\nConclusion In this post, we have seen how to use post-double selection and, more generally, double debiased machine learning to get rid of an important source of bias: regularization bias.\nThis contribution by Victor Chernozhukov and co-authors has been undoubtedly one of the most relevant advances in causal inferences in the last decade. It is now widely employed in the industry and included in the most used causal inference packages, such as EconML (Microsoft) and causalml (Uber).\nIf you (understandably) feel the need for more material on double-debiased machine learning, but you do not feel like reading academic papers (also very understandable), here is a good compromise.\n  In this video lecture, Victor Chernozhukov himself presents the idea. The video lecture is relatively heavy on math and statistics, but you cannot get a more qualified and direct source than this!\nReferences [1] A. Belloni, D. Chen, V. Chernozhukov, C.

We usually refer to these variables as control variables or confounders. In randomized control trials or AB tests, conditioning can increase the power of the analysis, by reducing imbalances that have emerged despite randomization. However, conditioning is even more important in observational studies, where, absent randomization, it might be essential to recover causal effects.\nWhen we have many control variables, we might want to select the most relevant ones, ppossibly capturing nonlinearities and interactions. Machine learning algorithms are perfect for this task. However, in these cases, we are introducing a bias that is called regularization or pre-test, or feature selection bias. In this and the next blog post, I try to explain the source of the bias and a very poweful solution called double debiased machine learning, which has been probably one of the most relevant advancement at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference of the last decade.\nPre-Testing Since this is a complex topic, let\u0026rsquo;s start with a simple example.\nSuppose we were a firm and we are interested in the effect of advertisement spending on revenue: is advertisement worth the money? There are also a lot of other things that might influence sales, therefore, we are thinking of controlling for past sales in the analysis, in order to increase the power of our analysis.\nAssume the data generating process can be represented with the following Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Therefore, we are happy with our specification and we conclude that the effect of ads on sales is positive and significant with a 95% confidence interval of $[0.912, 1.029]$.\nThe Bias There is an issue with this procedure: we are not taking into account the fact that we have run a test to decide whether to include past_sales in the regression. The fact that we have decided to include past_sales because its coefficient is significant does have an effect on the inference on the effect of ads on sales, $\\alpha$.\nThe best way to understand the problem is through simulations. Since we have access to the data generating process dgp_pretest() (unlike in real life), we can just test what would happen if we were repeating this procedure multiple times:\n We draw a new sample from the data generating process. We regress sales on ads and past_sales. If the coefficient of past_sales is significant at the 95% level, we keep $\\hat \\alpha_{long}$ from (2). Otherwise, we regress sales on ads only, and we keep that coefficient $\\hat \\alpha_{short}$.  I write a pre_test function to implement the procedure above. I also save the coefficients from both regressions, long and short, and the chosen one, called the pre-test coefficient.\nReminder: we are pre-testing the effect of past_sales on sales but the coefficient of interest is the one of ads on sales.\ndef pre_testing(d='ads', y='sales', x='past_sales', K=1000, **kwargs): # Init alpha = {'Long': np.zeros(K), 'Short': np.zeros(K), 'Pre-test': np.zeros(K)} # Loop over simulations for k in range(K): # Generate data df = dgp_pretest().generate_data(seed=k, **kwargs) # Compute coefficients alpha['Long'][k] = smf.ols(f'{y} ~ {d} + {x}', df).fit().params[1] alpha['Short'][k] = smf.ols(f'{y} ~ {d}', df).fit().params[1] # Compute significance of beta p_value = smf.ols(f'{y} ~ {d} + {x}', df).fit().pvalues[2] # Select specification based on p-value if p_value\u0026lt;0.05: alpha['Pre-test'][k] = alpha['Long'][k] else: alpha['Pre-test'][k] = alpha['Short'][k] return alpha  alphas = pre_testing()  We can now plot the distributions (over simulations) of the estimated coefficients.\ndef plot_alphas(alphas, true_alpha): # Init plot fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, len(alphas), figsize=(4*len(alphas), 5), sharey=True, sharex=True) # Make one plot for each set of coefficients for i, key in enumerate(alphas.keys()): axes[i].hist(alphas[key], bins=30, lw=.1) axes[i].set_title(key) axes[i].axvline(true_alpha, c='r', ls='--') legend_text = [r'$\\alpha=%.0f$' % true_alpha, r'$\\hat \\alpha=%.4f$' % np.mean(alphas[key])] axes[i].legend(legend_text, prop={'size': 10}, loc='upper right')  plot_alphas(alphas, true_alpha=1)  In the plot above, I have depicted the estimated coefficients, across simulations, for the different regression specifications.\nAs we can see from the first plot, if we were always running the long regression, our estimator $\\hat \\alpha_{long}$ would be unbiased and normally distributed. However, if we were always running the short regression (second plot), our estimator $\\hat \\alpha_{short}$ would be biased.\nThe pre-testing procedure generates an estimator $\\hat \\alpha_{pretest}$ that is a mix of the two: most of the times we select the correct specification, the long regression, but sometimes the pre-test fails to reject the null hypothesis of no effect of past sales on sales, $H_0 : \\beta = 0$, and we select the incorrect specification, running the short regression.\nImportantly, the pre-testing procedure does not generate a biased estimator. As we can see in the last plot, the estimated coefficient is very close to the true value, 1. The reason is that most of the time, the number of times we select the short regression is sufficiently small not to introduce bias, but not small enough to have valid inference.\nIndeed, pre-testing distorts inference: the distribution of the estimator $\\hat \\alpha_{pretest}$ is not normal anymore, but bimodal. The consequence is that our confidence intervals for $\\alpha$ are going to have the wrong coverage (contain the true effect with a different probability than the claimed one).\nWhen is pre-testing a problem? The problem of pre-testing arises because of the bias generated by running the short regression: omitted variable bias (OVB). In you are not familiar with OVB, I have written a short introduction here. In general however, we can express the omitted variable bias introduced by regressing $Y$ on $D$ ignoring $X$ as\n$$ \\text{OVB} = \\beta \\delta \\qquad \\text{ where } \\qquad \\beta := \\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{Var(X)}, \\quad \\delta := \\frac{Cov(D, X)}{Var(D)} $$\nWhere $\\beta$ is the effect of $X$ (past sales in our example) on $Y$ (sales) and $\\delta$ is the effect of $D$ (ads) on $X$.\nPre-testing is a problem if\n We run the short regression instead of the long one and The effect of the bias is sensible  What can help improving (1), i.e. the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis of zero effect of past sales, $H_0 : \\beta = 0$? The answer is simple: a bigger sample size. If we have more observations, we can more precisely estimate $\\beta$ and it is going to be less likely that we commit a type 2 error and run the short regression instead of the long one.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s simulate the estimated coefficient $\\hat \\alpha$ under different sample sizes. Remember that the sample size used until now is $N=1000$.\nNs = [100,300,1000,3000] alphas = {f'N = {n:.0f}': pre_testing(N=n)['Pre-test'] for n in Ns} plot_alphas(alphas, true_alpha=1)  As we can see from the plots, as the sample size increases (left to right), the bias decreases and the distribution of the estimator $\\hat \\alpha_{pretest}$ converges to a normal distribution.\nWhat happens instead if the value of $\\beta$ was different? It is probably going to affect point (2) in the previous paragraph, but how?\n  If $\\beta$ is very small, it is going to be hard to detect it, and we will often end up running the short regression, introducing a bias. However, if $\\beta$ is very small, it also implies that the magnitude of the bias is small and therefore it is not going to affect our estimate of $\\alpha$ much\n  If $\\beta$ is very big, it is going to be easy to detect and we will often end up running the long regression, avoiding the bias (which would have been very big though).\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s simulate the estimated coefficient $\\hat \\alpha$ under different values of $\\beta$. The true value used until now was $\\beta = 0.3$.\nbetas = 0.3 * np.array([0.1,0.3,1,3]) alphas = {f'beta = {b:.2f}': pre_testing(b=b)['Pre-test'] for b in betas} plot_alphas(alphas, true_alpha=1)  As we can see from the plots, as the value of $\\beta$ increases, the bias first appears and then disappears. When $\\beta$ is small (left plot), we often choose the short regression, but the bias is small and the average estimate is very close to the true value. For intermediate values of $\\beta$, the bias is sensible and it has a clear effect on inference. Lastly, for large values of $\\beta$ instead (right plot), we always run the long regression and the bias disappears.\nBut when is a coefficient big or small? And big or small with respect to what? The answer is simple: with respect to the sample size, or more accurately, with respect to the inverse of the square root of the sample size, $1 / \\sqrt{n}$. The reason is deeply rooted in the Central Limit Theorem, but I won\u0026rsquo;t cover it here.\nThe idea is easier to show than to explain, so let\u0026rsquo;s repeat the same simulation as above, but now we will increase both the coefficient and the sample size at the same time.\nbetas = 0.3 * 30 / np.sqrt(Ns) alphas = {f'N = {n:.0f}': pre_testing(b=b, N=n)['Pre-test'] for n,b in zip(Ns,betas)} plot_alphas(alphas, true_alpha=1)  As we can see, now that $\\beta$ is proportional to $1 / \\sqrt{n}$, the distortion is not going away, not matter the sample size. Therefore, inference will always be wrong.\nWhile a coefficient that depends on the sample size might sound not intuitive, it captures well the idea of magnitude in a world where we do inference relying on asymptotic results, first among all the Central Limit Theorem. In fact, the Central Limit Theorem relieas on an infinitely large sample size. However, with an infinite amount of data, no coefficient is small and any non-zero effect is detected with certainty.\nPre-Testing and Machine Learning So far we talked about a linear regression with only 2 variables. Where is the machine learning we were promised?\nUsually we do not have just one control variable (or confounder), but many. Moreover, we might want to be flexible with respect to the functional form through which these control variables enter the model. In general, we will assume the following model:\n$$ Y = \\alpha D + g_0(X) + u \\newline D = m_0(X) + v $$\nWhere the effect of interest is still $\\alpha$, $X$ is potentially high dimensional and we do not take a stand on the functional form through which $X$ influences $D$ or $Y$.\nIn this setting, it is natural to use a machine learning algorithm to estimate $g_0$ and $m_0$. However, machine learning algorithms usually introduce a regularization bias that is comparable to pre-testing.\nPossibly, the \u0026ldquo;simplest\u0026rdquo; way to think about it is Lasso. Lasso is linear in $X$, with a penalization term that effectively just performs the variable selection we discussed above. Therefore, if we were to use Lasso of $X$ and $D$ on $Y$ we would be introducing regularization bias and inference would be distorted. The same goes for more complex algorithms.\nLastly, you might still wonder \u0026ldquo;why is the model linear in the treatment variable $D$?\u0026rdquo;. Doing inference is much easier in linear model, not only for computational reasons but also for interpretation. Moreover, if the treatment $D$ is binary, the linear functional form is without loss of generality. A stronger assumption is the additive separability of $D$ and $g(X)$.\nConclusion In this post, I have tried to explain how does regularization bias emerges and why it can the an issue in causal inference. This problem is inherently related to settings with many control variables or where we would like to have a model-free (i.e. non-parametric) when controlling for confounders. These are exactly the settings in which machine learning algorithms can be useful.\nIn the next post, I will cover a simple and yet incredibly powerful solution to this problem: double-debiased machine learning.\nReferences [1] A.

Let\u0026rsquo;s see it together.\nTest 1: Discrete Distribution Suppose you want to test whether a dice is fair. You throw the dice 60 times and you count the number of times you get each outcome.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s simulate some data (from a fair dice).\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import *  def generate_data_dice(N=60, seed=1): np.random.seed(seed) # Set seed for replicability dice_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6] # Dice numbers dice_throws = np.random.choice(dice_numbers, size=N) # Actual dice throws data = pd.DataFrame({\u0026quot;dice number\u0026quot;: dice_numbers, \u0026quot;observed\u0026quot;: [sum(dice_throws==n) for n in dice_numbers], \u0026quot;expected\u0026quot;: int(N / 6)}) return data  data_dice = generate_data_dice() data_dice   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  dice number observed expected     0 1 10 10   1 2 14 10   2 3 6 10   3 4 8 10   4 5 12 10   5 6 10 10     If we were throwing the dice a lot of times, we would expect the same number of observations for each outcome. However, there is inherent noise in the process. How can we tell whether the fact that we didn\u0026rsquo;t get exactly 10 observations for each outcome is just due to randomness or it\u0026rsquo;s because the dice is unfair?\nThe idea is to compute some statistic whose distribution is known under the assumption that the dice is fair, and then check if its value is \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo; or not. If the value is particularly \u0026ldquo;unusual\u0026rdquo;, we reject the null hypothesis that the dice is fair.\nIn our case, the statistic we choose is the chi-squared $\\chi^{2}$ test-statistic.\nThe value of the Pearson\u0026rsquo;s chi-squared test-statistic is\n$$ T_{\\chi^2} = \\sum _{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^{2}}{E_i} = N \\sum _{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\left(O_i/N - p_i \\right)^2 }{p_i} $$\nwhere\n $O_{i}$ = the number of observations of type i. $N$ = total number of observations $E_{i}=N * p_{i}$ = the expected (theoretical) count of type $i$, asserted by the null hypothesis that the fraction of type $i$ in the population is $p_{i}$ $n$ = the number of cells in the table.  def compute_chi2_stat(data): return sum( (data.observed - data.expected)**2 / data.expected )  chi2_stat = compute_chi2_stat(data_dice) chi2_stat  4.0  What do we make of this number? Is it unusual?\nIf the dice were fair, the test Pearson\u0026rsquo;s chi-squared test-statistic $T_{\\chi^2}$ would be distributed as a chi-squared distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom, $\\chi^2_{k-1}$. For the moment, take this claim at face value, we will verify it later, both empirically and theoretically. We will also discuss the degrees of freedom in detail later on.\nImportant! Do not confuse the chi-squared test statistic (a number) with the chi-squared distribution (a distribution).\nWhat does a chi-squared distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom, $\\chi^2_{k-1}$, look like?\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2 x = np.arange(0, 30, 0.001) # x-axis ranges from 0 to 30 with .001 steps chi2_5_pdf = chi2.pdf(x, df=5) # Chi-square distribution with 5 degrees of freedom plt.plot(x, chi2_5_pdf);  How does the value of the statistic we have observed compares with its the distribution under the null hypothesis of a fair dice?\nplt.plot(x, chi2.pdf(x, df=5), label='chi2 distribution'); plt.axvline(chi2_stat, color='k', label='chi2 statistic') plt.legend();  The test statistic seems to fall well within the distribution, i.e. it does not seem to be an unusual event. Indeed, the question we want to answer is: \u0026ldquo;under the null hypothesis that the dice is fair, how unlikely is the statistic we have observed?\u0026rdquo;.\nThe last component we need in order to build a hypothesis test is a level of confidence, i.e. a threshold of \u0026ldquo;unlikeliness\u0026rdquo; of an event, below which we declare that the event is too unlikely under the model, for the model to be true. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we decide to set that threshold at 5%.\nIf the likelihood of observing an even that (or more) extreme than the one we have actually observed is less than 5%, we reject the null hypothesis that the dice is fair.\nWhat is this value for a chi-squared distribution with 5 degrees of freedom? We can compute the percent point function (ppf) of 95% for the chi-squared distribution, which is essentially the inverse of the cumulative distribution function. This value is often called the critical value.\nz95 = chi2.ppf(0.95, df=5) z95  11.070497693516351  Since our value is smaller than the critical value, we do not reject the null. The critical value is indeed critical because it splits the domain of the test statistic into two areas: the rejection area, where we reject the null hypothesis, and the non-rejection area, where we don\u0026rsquo;t.\nWe can plot the rejection and non-rejection areas in a plot.\ndef plot_test(x, stat, df): z95 = chi2.ppf(0.95, df=df) chi2_pdf = chi2.pdf(x, df=df) plt.plot(x, chi2_pdf); plt.fill_between(x[x\u0026gt;z95], chi2_pdf[x\u0026gt;z95], color='r', alpha=0.4, label='rejection area') plt.fill_between(x[x\u0026lt;z95], chi2_pdf[x\u0026lt;z95], color='g', alpha=0.4, label='non-rejection area') plt.axvline(chi2_stat, color='k', label='chi2 statistic') plt.ylim(0, plt.ylim()[1]) plt.legend();  plot_test(x, chi2_stat, df=5)  From the plot, we can see that we do not reject the null hypothesis that the dice is fair for our value of the $\\chi^2$ test statistic.\nWhy the Chi-squared Distribution? How do we know that that particular statistic has that particular distribution?\nBefore digging into the math, we can check this claim via simulation. Since we have access to the data generating process, we can repeat the procedure above many times, i.e.\n roll a (fair) dice 60 times compute the chi-square statistic  and then plot the distribution of chi square statistics.\ndef simulate_chi2stats(K, N, dgp): chi2_stats = [compute_chi2_stat(dgp(seed=k)) for k in range(K)] return np.array(chi2_stats)  chi2_stats = simulate_chi2stats(K=100, N=60, dgp=generate_data_dice)  plt.hist(chi2_stats, density=True, bins=30, alpha=0.3, color='C0'); plt.plot(x, chi2_5_pdf);  Since we only did it 100 times, the distribution looks pretty coarse but vaguely close to its theoretical counterpart. Let\u0026rsquo;s try 1000 times.\nchi2_stats = simulate_chi2stats(K=1000, N=60, dgp=generate_data_dice)  plt.hist(chi2_stats, density=True, bins=30, alpha=0.3, color='C0'); plt.plot(x, chi2_5_pdf);  The empirical distribution of the test statistic is indeed very close to its theoretical counterpart.\nSome Statistics Why does the distribution of the test statistic look like that? Let\u0026rsquo;s now dig deeper into the math.\nThere are two things we need to know in order to understand the answer:\n the Central Limit Theorem the relationship between a chi-squared and a normal distribution  The Wikipedia definition of the Central Limit Theorem says that\n \u0026ldquo;In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) establishes that, in many situations, when independent random variables are summed up, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution (informally a bell curve) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.\u0026rdquo;\n Where does a normal distribution come up in our case? If we look at a single row in our data, i.e. the occurrences of a specific dice throw, it can be interpreted as the sum of realization from a Bernoulli distribution with probability 1/6.\n \u0026ldquo;In probability theory and statistics, the Bernoulli distribution is the discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value $1$ with probability $p$ and the value $0$ with probability $q=1-p$.\u0026rdquo;\n In our case, the probability of getting a particular number is exactly 1/6. What is the distribution of the sum of its realizations? The Central Limit Theorem also tells us that:\n \u0026ldquo;If $X_1, X_2, \\dots , X_n, \\dots$ are random samples drawn from a population with overall mean $\\mu$ and finite variance $\\sigma^2$, and if $\\bar X_n$ is the sample mean of the first $n$ samples, then the limiting form of the distribution,\n$$ Z = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{n} \\left( \\frac{\\bar X_n - \\mu }{\\sigma} \\right) $$\nis a standard normal distribution.\u0026rdquo;\n Therefore, in our case, the distribution of the sum of Bernoulli distributions with mean $p$ is distributed as a normal distribution with\n mean $p$ variance $p * (1-p)$  Therefore, we can obtain a random variable that is asymptotically standard normal distributed as\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ \\sqrt{n} \\left( \\frac {\\bar X_n - p}{\\sqrt{p * (1-p)}} \\right) \\sim N(0,1) $$\nOur last piece: what is a chi-squared distribution? The Wikipedia definition says\n \u0026ldquo;If $Z_1, \u0026hellip;, Z_k$ are independent, standard normal random variables, then the sum of their squares,\n$$ Q = \\sum_{i=1}^k Z_i^2 $$ is distributed according to the chi-squared distribution with $k$ degrees of freedom.\u0026rdquo;\n I.e. the sum of standard normal distributions is a chi-squared distribution, where the degrees of freedom indicate the number of normal distributions we are summing over. Since the normalized sum of realizations of each dice number should converge to a standard normal distribution, their sum of squares should converge to a chi-squared distribution. I.e.\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ \\sum_k n \\frac{(\\bar X_n - p)^2}{p * (1-p)} \\sim \\chi^2_k $$\nThere is just one issue: the last distribution is not really independent from the others. In fact, as soon as we know that we have thrown 60 dices and how many 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s we got, we can compute the number of 6s. Therefore, we should exclude one distribution since only 5 (or, in general, $k-1$) are truly independent.\nIn practice, however, we sum all distributions, but then we scale them down by multiplying them by $(1-p)$ so that we have\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ \\sum_k n \\frac{(\\bar X_n - p)^2}{p} \\sim \\chi^2_{k-1} $$\nwhich is exactly the formula we used to compute the test statistic:\n$$ T_{\\chi^2} = \\sum _{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^{2}}{E_i} = N \\sum _{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\left(O_i/N - p_i \\right)^2 }{p_i} $$\nTest 2: Independence Chi-squared tests can also be used to test independence between two variables. The idea is fundamentally the same as the test in the previous section: checking systematic differences between observed and expected values, across different variables.\nSuppose you have data on grades in a classroom, by gender. Grades go from $1$ to $4$. Assuming males and females are equally prepared for the test, you want to test whether there has been discrimination in grading.\nThe problem is again asserting whether the observed differences are random or systematic.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s generate some data (under the no discrimination assumption).\ndef generate_data_grades(N_male=60, N_female=40, seed=1): np.random.seed(seed) grade_scale = [1,2,3,4] p = [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.2] grades_male = np.random.choice(grade_scale, size=N_male, p=p) grades_female = np.random.choice(grade_scale, size=N_female, p=p) data = pd.DataFrame({\u0026quot;grade\u0026quot;: grade_scale + grade_scale, \u0026quot;gender\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;male\u0026quot; for i in grade_scale] + [\u0026quot;female\u0026quot; for i in grade_scale], \u0026quot;observed\u0026quot;: [sum(grades_male==n) for n in grade_scale] + [sum(grades_female==n) for n in grade_scale], }) data['expected gender'] = data.groupby(\u0026quot;gender\u0026quot;)[\u0026quot;observed\u0026quot;].transform(\u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;) data['expected grade'] = data.groupby(\u0026quot;grade\u0026quot;)[\u0026quot;observed\u0026quot;].transform(\u0026quot;mean\u0026quot;) data['expected'] = data['expected gender'] * data['expected grade'] / data['observed'].mean() return data  data_grades = generate_data_grades() data_grades   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  grade gender observed expected gender expected grade expected     0 1 male 9 15.0 5.5 6.6   1 2 male 14 15.0 10.5 12.6   2 3 male 27 15.0 24.5 29.4   3 4 male 10 15.0 9.5 11.4   4 1 female 2 10.0 5.5 4.4   5 2 female 7 10.0 10.5 8.4   6 3 female 22 10.0 24.5 19.6   7 4 female 9 10.0 9.5 7.6     Has there been discrimination? We again compare observed and expected grades, where expected grades are computed under the independence assumption: as the product of the marginal distributions of grade and gender.\nThe value of the test-statistic is\n$$ T_{\\chi^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^r \\sum_{j=1}^c \\frac{(O_{i,j} - E_{i,j})^2 }{ E_{i,j} } = N \\sum_{i,j} p_{i \\cdot} p_{\\cdot j} \\left( \\frac{O_{i,j}/N - p_{i \\cdot} p_{\\cdot j} }{ p_{i \\cdot} p_{\\cdot j}} \\right)^2 $$\nwhere\n  $N$ is the total sample size (the sum of all cells in the table)\n  $p_{i \\cdot} = \\frac{O_{i\\cdot }}{N} = \\sum_{j=1}^{c} \\frac{O_{i,j}}{N}$ is the fraction of observations of type i ignoring the column attribute (fraction of row totals), and\n  $p_{\\cdot j} = \\frac{O_{\\cdot j}}{N} = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{O_{i,j}}{N}$ is the fraction of observations of type j ignoring the row attribute (fraction of column totals).\n  So the formula for the test statistic is the same\nchi2_stat = compute_chi2_stat(data_grades) chi2_stat  3.490327550477927  As before, we can double-check whether the statistic is indeed distributed as a chi-squared with $k-1$ degrees of freedom by simulating the data generating process.\nchi2_stats = simulate_chi2stats(K=1000, N=60, dgp=generate_data_grades) plt.hist(chi2_stats, density=True, bins=30, alpha=0.3, color='C0'); plt.plot(x, chi2_5_pdf);  The two distributions do not look similar anymore.\nWhat happened? We forgot to change the degrees of freedom! The general formula for the degrees of freedom when testing the independence of variables is $(N_i - 1) \\times (N_j - 1)$. So in our case, it\u0026rsquo;s $(4-1) \\times (2-1) = 3$.\nchi2_3_pdf = chi2.pdf(x, df=3) chi2_stats = simulate_chi2stats(K=1000, N=60, dgp=generate_data_grades) plt.hist(chi2_stats, density=True, bins=30, alpha=0.3, color='C0'); plt.plot(x, chi2_3_pdf);  Now the empirical distribution is close to its theoretical counterpart.\nDo we reject the null hypothesis of independent distributions of gender and grades? We can visualize the value of the test statistic together with the rejection areas.\nplot_test(x, chi2_stat, df=3)  We do not reject the null hypothesis of independend distributions of gender and grades.\nTest 3: Continuous Distributions As we have seen, the chi-square test can be used to compare observed means/frequencies against a null hypothesis. How can we use this statistic to test a distributional assumption?\nThe answer is simple: we can construct conditional means. The easiest way to do it is to bin the data into intervals and then check if the observed frequencies match the expected probabilities, within each bin.\nNote: a good practice is to have equally sized bins, in terms of expected probabilities, since it ensures that we have as many observations in each bin as possible.\nAs an example, let\u0026rsquo;s assume we have to analyze the customer service of a firm.

We have seen how to compute the statistic, why it has a chi-squared distribution, and how to use this information to perform a statistical hypothesis test.\nCode You can find the original Jupyter Notebook here:\nhttps://github.com/matteocourthoud/Blog-Posts/blob/main/notebooks/chisquared.ipynb\n","date":1653955200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653955200,"objectID":"6cc8886782d077be8d6a99ab075dcb4a","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/post/chisquared/","publishdate":"2022-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/chisquared/","section":"post","summary":"If you search the Wikipedia definition of Chi-Squared test, you get the following definition:\n Pearson\u0026rsquo;s chi-squared test $\\chi^2$ is a statistical test applied to sets of categorical data to evaluate how likely it is that any observed difference between the sets arose by chance.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding The Chi-Squared Test","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The problem of comparing distributions often arises in causal inference when we have to assess the quality of randomization.\nWhen we want to assess the causal effect of a policy (or, feature, campaign, drug, \u0026hellip;), the golden standard in causal inference are randomized control trials, also known in the industry as A/B tests. In practice, we select a sample for the study and we randomly split it into a control and a treatment group, to compare the outcomes between the two groups. The idea is that, under a set of assumption, randomization assures that only difference between the two groups is the treatment, on average. Therefore, we can attribute the differences in outcomes to the treatment effect alone.\nThe problem is that, despite randomization, the two groups are never identical. However, sometimes, they are not even \u0026ldquo;similar\u0026rdquo;. For example, we might have more females in one group, or older people, etc.. (we usually call these characteristics, covariates or control variables). When it happens, we cannot be certain anymore that the differences in the outcome is only due to the treatment and cannot be attributed to the inbalanced covariates instead. Therefore, it is always important, after randomization, to check whether all observed variables are balance across groups and whether there are no systematic differences. Another option, to be certain that certain covariates are balanced, is stratified sampling.\nIn this blog post, we are going to see different ways to compare two (or more) distributions and assess the magnitude and significance of their difference. We are going to consider two different approaches, graphical and numerical. The two approaches generally trade-off intuition with rigour: from plots we can assess subtle differences but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to assess whether these differences are systematic or due to noise.\nThe Data Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we need to perform an experiment on a group of individuals and we have randomized them into a treatment and control group. We would like them to be as comparable as possible, in order to attribute any difference between the two groups to the treatment effect alone. We also have divided the treatment group in different arms for testing different treatments.\nFor this example, I have simulated a dataset of 1000 individuals, for whom we observe a set of characteristics. I import the data generating process dgp_rnd_assignment() from src.dgp and some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_rnd_assignment df = dgp_rnd_assignment().generate_data() df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  group arm gender age income     0 control arm 2 0 29.0 3967.16   1 control arm 4 1 32.0 2927.77   2 treatment NaN 0 29.0 1642.66   3 control arm 4 0 25.0 1867.64   4 treatment NaN 1 32.0 3202.35     We have information on $1000$ individuals, for which we observe gender, age and income.\nWe now want to understand whether the treatment and control groups are comparable or if there are systematic difference between them.\nPlots Let\u0026rsquo;s concentrate on one variable: income. Does the income distribution differ between the two groups?\nA first approach could be the boxplot. The boxplot is a good trade-off between summary statistics and data visualization. The center and the borders of the box represent the median and the first (Q1) and third quartile (Q3), respectively. The whiskers instead, extend to the first data points that are more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (Q3 - Q1) outside the box. The points that fall outside of the whiskers are plotted individually.\nTherefore, the boxplot provides both summary statistics (the box and the whiskers) and direct data visualization (the extreme data points).\nsns.boxplot(x='group', y='income', data=df); plt.title(\u0026quot;Boxplot\u0026quot;);  It seems that the income distribution in the treatment group is slightly more dispersed: the orange box is larger and the extreme treatment points cover a wider range. However, the issue with the boxplot is that it hides the shape of the data, telling us some summary statistics but not showing us the actual data distribution.\nThe most intuitive way to plot a distribution is the histogram. The histogram groups the data into equally spaced bins and plots the number of observations within each bin.\nsns.histplot(x='income', data=df, hue='group', bins=50); plt.title(\u0026quot;Histogram\u0026quot;);  There are multiple issues with this plot:\n The two histograms are not comparable: we would like a density, not a count The number of bins is arbitrary  We can solve the first issue using the stat option to plot the density instead of the count and setting the common_norm option to False to use the same normalization.\nsns.histplot(x='income', data=df, hue='group', bins=50, stat='density', common_norm=False); plt.title(\u0026quot;Density Histogram\u0026quot;);  Now the two histograms are comparable!\nHowever, an important issue remains: the size of the bins is arbitrary. If we bunch the data less, we end up with bins with one observation at most, if we bunch the data more, we lose information. This is a classical bias-variance trade-off.\nOne possible solution is to use a kernel density function that tries to approximate the histogram with a continuous function, using kernel density estimation (KDE).\nsns.kdeplot(x='income', data=df, hue='group', common_norm=False); plt.title(\u0026quot;Kernel Density Function\u0026quot;);  We can now visualize both distributions very intuitively.\nIf we had multiple categories, a very similar plot is the violinplot. The violinplot also performs kernel density estimation, but plots separate densities along the y axis so that they don\u0026rsquo;t overlap. By default, it also adds a miniature boxplot inside.\nsns.violinplot(x='arm', y='income', data=df); plt.title(\u0026quot;Violin Plot\u0026quot;);  From the plot, it seems that the estimated kernel density of income is very similar across treatment arms.\nHowever, the issue with kernel density estimation is that it is somehow a black-box and might mask relevant features of the data.\nA much more transparent representation of the two distribution is their cumulative distribution function. At each point of the x axis (income) we plot the percentage of data points that have an equal or lower value. The main advantages of the cumulative distribution function are that\n we do not need to make any arbitrary choice (e.g. number of bins) we do not need to perform any approximation (e.g. with KDE)  sns.histplot(x='income', data=df, hue='group', bins=len(df), stat=\u0026quot;density\u0026quot;, element=\u0026quot;step\u0026quot;, fill=False, cumulative=True, common_norm=False); plt.title(\u0026quot;Cumulative distribution function\u0026quot;);  We can now clearly see that there are relatively more observations with low income in the treatment group than in the control group. In fact, the blue line is above the orange line on the right and below the orange line on the left.\nA related alternative method is the qq-plot, where q stands for quantile. The qq-plot plots the quantiles of the two distributions against each other. If the distributions are the same, we should get the 45 degree line.\nThere is no native qq-plot function in Python and, while the statsmodels package provides a qqplot function, it is quite cumbersome. Therefore, we will do it by hand.\nFirst, we need to compute the quartiles of the two groups, using the percentile function.\nincome = df['income'].values income_t = df.loc[df.group=='treatment', 'income'].values income_c = df.loc[df.group=='control', 'income'].values df_pct = pd.DataFrame() df_pct['q_treatment'] = np.percentile(income_t, range(100)) df_pct['q_control'] = np.percentile(income_c, range(100))  Now we can plot the two quantile distributions against each other, plus the 45-degree line, representing the benchmark perfect fit.\nplt.scatter(x='q_control', y='q_treatment', data=df_pct, label='Actual fit'); sns.lineplot(x='q_control', y='q_control', data=df_pct, color='r', label='Line of perfect fit'); plt.xlabel('Quantile of income, control group') plt.ylabel('Quantile of income, treatment group') plt.legend() plt.title(\u0026quot;QQ plot\u0026quot;);  The qq-plot delivers a very similar insight with respect to the cumulative distribution plot: income in the treatment group is generally lower.\nTests So far, we have seen different ways to visualize differences between distributions. The main advantage of visualization is intuition: we can eyeball the differences and intuitively assess them.\nHowever, we might want to be more rigorous and try to assess the statistical significance of the difference between the distributions, i.e. answer the question \u0026ldquo;is the observed difference systematic or due to sampling variation?\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are now going to analyze different tests to discern two distributions from each other.\nT-test The first and most common test is the student t-test. T-tests are generally used to compare means. In this case, we want to test whether the means of the income distribution is the same across the two groups. The test statistic for the two-means comparison test is given by:\n$$ stat = \\frac{|\\bar x_1 - \\bar x_2|}{\\sqrt{s_1 / n_1 + s_2 / n_2}} $$\nWhere $\\bar x$ is the sample mean and $s$ is the sample standard deviation. Under mild conditions, the test statistic is asymptotically distributed as a student t distribution.\nWe use the ttest_ind function from scipy to perform the t-test. The function returns both the test statistic and the implied p-value.\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind stat, p_value = ttest_ind(income_c, income_t) print(f\u0026quot;t-test: statistic={stat:.4f}, p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)  t-test: statistic=-1.3192, p-value=0.1874  In general, it is common practice to always perform this test on all variables, when we are running a randomized control trial or A/B test. The results of these tests are usually collected into a table that is called balance table.\nWe can use the create_table_one function from the causalml library to generate the balance table. As the name of the function suggests, the balance table should always be the first table you present when performing an A/B test.\nfrom causalml.match import create_table_one df['treatment'] = df['group']=='treatment' create_table_one(df, 'treatment', ['gender', 'age', 'income'])   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  Control Treatment SMD   Variable        n 704 296    age 31.94 (8.53) 35.88 (7.78) 0.4822   gender 0.51 (0.50) 0.58 (0.49) 0.1419   income 3166.07 (1321.89) 3296.32 (1645.58) 0.0873     In the first two columns, we can see the average of the different variables across the treatment and control groups, with standard errors in parenthesis. In the last column, we have the p-values of the t-test for the null hypothesis of zero difference in means.\nFrom the table, we observe that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of zero difference in mean for any variable, at the 95% confidence level.\nChi-Squared Test The chi-squared test is a very powerful test that can be used in many different settings. If you want to find out more about it, I have written a very comprehensive blog post here.\nOne of the least known applications of the chi-squared test, is testing the similarity between two distributions. The idea is to bin the observations of the two groups. If the two distributions were the same, we would expect the same frequency of observations in each bin. Importantly, we need enough observations in each bin, in order for the test to be valid. I generate bins corresponding to deciles of the distribution of income in the control group.\ndf_bins = pd.DataFrame() _, bins = pd.qcut(income_c, q=10, retbins=True) df_bins['bin'] = pd.cut(income_c, bins=bins).value_counts().index df_bins['income_c'] = pd.cut(income_c, bins=bins).value_counts().values df_bins['income_t'] = pd.cut(income_t, bins=bins).value_counts().values df_bins   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  bin income_c income_t     0 (808.96, 1730.77] 70 42   1 (1730.77, 2127.948] 70 36   2 (2127.948, 2411.451] 70 25   3 (2411.451, 2670.312] 71 20   4 (2670.312, 2935.05] 70 26   5 (2935.05, 3208.662] 70 13   6 (3208.662, 3542.805] 71 25   7 (3542.805, 3972.996] 70 26   8 (3972.996, 4912.782] 70 41   9 (4912.782, 11634.39] 71 42     We can now perform the test by comparing the frequencies of the two distributions, across bins. The test statistic is given by:\n$$ stat = \\sum _{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^{2}}{E_i} $$\nWhere the bins are indexed by $i$ and $O$ is the observed number of data points in bin $i$ and $E$ is the expected number of data points in bin $i$. Since we generated the bins using deciles of the distribution of income in the control group, we expect the number of observations per bin in the treatment group to be the same across bins. Under mild assumptions, the test statistic is asymptocally distributed as a chi-squared distribution.\nTo compute the test statistic and the p-value of the test, we use the chisquare function from scipy.\nfrom scipy.stats import chisquare df_bins['income_t_norm'] = df_bins['income_t'] / np.sum(df_bins['income_t']) * np.sum(df_bins['income_c']) stat, p_value = chisquare(df_bins['income_c'], df_bins['income_t_norm']) print(f\u0026quot;Chi-squared Test: statistic={stat:.4f}, p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)  Chi-squared Test: statistic=95.2526, p-value=0.0000  The p-value is practically zero, implying that we reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the two distributions.\nKolmogorov-Smirnov Test The idea of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, is to compare the cumulative distributions of the two groups. In particular, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is the maximum absolute difference between the two cumulative distributions.\n$$ stat = \\sup _{x} \\ \\Big| \\ F_1(x) - F_2(x) \\ \\Big| $$\nWhere $F_1$ and $F_2$ are the two cumulative distribution functions and $x$ are the values of the underlying variable. Under mild conditions, the asymptotic distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is known.\nTo better understand the test, let\u0026rsquo;s plot the cumulative distribution functions and the test statistic. First, we compute the cumulative distribution functions.\ndf_ks = pd.DataFrame() df_ks['income'] = np.sort(df['income'].unique()) df_ks['F_control'] = df_ks['income'].apply(lambda x: np.mean(income_c\u0026lt;=x)) df_ks['F_treatment'] = df_ks['income'].apply(lambda x: np.mean(income_t\u0026lt;=x)) df_ks.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  income F_control F_treatment     0 808.96 0.001420 0.000000   1 831.93 0.002841 0.000000   2 893.28 0.002841 0.003378   3 925.08 0.004261 0.003378   4 951.21 0.004261 0.006757     We now need to find the point where the absolute distance between the cumulative distribution functions is largest.\nk = np.argmax( np.abs(df_ks['F_control'] - df_ks['F_treatment'])) tstat = np.abs(df_ks['F_treatment'][k] - df_ks['F_control'][k])  We can visualize the value of the test statistic, by plotting the two cumulative distribution functions and the value of the test statistic.\ny = (df_ks['F_treatment'][k] + df_ks['F_control'][k])/2 plt.plot('income', 'F_control', data=df_ks, label='Control') plt.plot('income', 'F_treatment', data=df_ks, label='Treatment') plt.errorbar(x=df_ks['income'][k], y=y, yerr=tstat/2, color='k', capsize=5, mew=3, label=f\u0026quot;Test statistic: {tstat:.4f}\u0026quot;) plt.legend(loc='center right'); plt.title(\u0026quot;Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test\u0026quot;);  From the plot, we can see that the value of the test statistic corresponds to the distance between the two cumulative distributions at income=4000. For that value of income, we have the largest imbalance between the two groups.\nWe can now perform the actual test using the kstest function from scipy.\nfrom scipy.stats import kstest stat, p_value = kstest(income_t, income_c) print(f\u0026quot; Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test: statistic={stat:.4f}, p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)   Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test: statistic=0.0881, p-value=0.0730  The p-value is still above 5%: we do not reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same, with 95% confidence.\nPermutation Testing A non-parametric alternative is permutation testing. The idea is that, under the null hypothesis, the two distributions should be the same, therefore shuffling the observations across groups, should not significantly alter any statistic.\nWe can then chose any statistic and compute how much more extreme it is for different permutations, with respect to its value in the original sample. For example, let\u0026rsquo;s use as a test statistic the sample mean of the treatment group.\nstats = [np.mean(np.random.choice(income, size=len(income_t), replace=False)) for _ in range(1000)] p_value = np.mean(stats \u0026gt; np.mean(income_t)) print(f\u0026quot;Permutation test: p-value={p_value:.4f}\u0026quot;)  Permutation test: p-value=0.0820  The permutation test gives us a p-value very similar to the ones obtained with the other tests.\nHow do we interpret the p-value? It means that he sample mean of the treatment group in the data is larger than $1 - 0.082 = 91.8%$ of the sample means of the treatment group across the permuted samples.\nWe can visualize the test, by plotting the distribution of the test statistics against its sample value.\nplt.hist(stats, label='Permutation Statistics'); plt.axvline(x=np.mean(income_t), c='r', ls='--', label='Sample Statistic'); plt.legend(); plt.title('Permutation Test');  As we can see, the sample statistic is quite extreme with respect to the values in the permuted samples, but not excessively.\nConclusion TBD\n","date":1653782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653782400,"objectID":"81171df4e768a06dbf2989d511dc9c4f","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/post/distr_compare/","publishdate":"2022-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/distr_compare/","section":"post","summary":"The problem of comparing distributions often arises in causal inference when we have to assess the quality of randomization.\nWhen we want to assess the causal effect of a policy (or, feature, campaign, drug, \u0026hellip;), the golden standard in causal inference are randomized control trials, also known in the industry as A/B tests.","tags":null,"title":"Comparing Distributions, From Zero to Hero","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In causal inference, bias is extremely problematic because it makes inference not valid. Bias generally means that an estimator will not deliver the estimate of the true effect, on average.\nThis is why, in general, we prefer estimators that are unbiased, at the cost of a higher variance, i.e. more noise. Does it mean that every biased estimator is useless? Actually no. Sometimes, with domain knowledge, we can still draw causal conclusions even with a biased estimator.\nIn this post, we are going to review a specific but frequent source of bias, omitted variable bias (OVB). We are going to explore the causes of the bias and leverage these insights to make causal statements, despite the bias.\nTheory Suppose we are interested in the effect of a variable $D$ on a variable $y$. However, there is a third variable $Z$ that we do not observe and that is correlated with both $D$ and $Y$. Assume the data generating process can be represented with the following Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If you are not familiar with DAGs, I have written a short introduction here.\nflowchart LR classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; D((D)) Z((Z)) Y((Y)) D --\u0026gt; Y Z --\u0026gt; D Z --\u0026gt; Y class D,Y excluded; class Z unobserved;  Since there is a backdoor path from $D$ to $y$ passing through $Z$, we need to condition our analysis on $Z$ in order to recover the causal effect of $D$ on $y$. If we could observe $Z$, we would run a linear regression of $y$ on $D$ and $Z$ to estimate the following model:\n$$ y = \\alpha D + \\gamma Z + \\varepsilon $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the effect of interest. This regression is usually referred to as the long regression since it includes all variables of the model.\nHowever, since we do not observe $Z$, we have to estimate the following model:\n$$ y = \\alpha D + u $$\nThe corresponding regression is usually referred to as the short regression since it does not include all the variables of the model\nWhat is the consequence of estimating the short regression when the true model is the long one?\nIn that case, the OLS estimator of $\\alpha$ is\n$$ \\begin{align} \\hat \\alpha \u0026amp;= \\frac{Cov(D, y)}{Var(D)} = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{Cov(D, \\alpha D + \\gamma Z + \\varepsilon)}{Var(D)} = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\frac{Cov(D, \\alpha D)}{Var(D)} + \\frac{Cov(D, \\gamma Z)}{Var(D)} + \\frac{Cov(D, \\varepsilon)}{Var(D)} = \\newline \u0026amp;= \\alpha + \\underbrace{ \\gamma \\frac{Cov(D, Z)}{Var(D)} }_{\\text{omitted variable bias}} \\end{align} $$\nTherefore, we can write the omitted variable bias as\n$$ \\text{OVB} = \\gamma \\delta \\qquad \\text{ where } \\qquad \\delta := \\frac{Cov(D, Z)}{Var(D)} $$\nThe beauty of this formula is its interpretability: the omitted variable bias consists in just two components, both extremely easy to interpret.\n $\\gamma$: the effect of $Z$ on $y$ $\\delta$: the effect of $D$ on $Z$  Additional Controls What happens if we had additional control variables in the regression? For example, assume that besides the variable of interest $D$, we also observe a vector of other variables $X$ so that the long regression is\n$$ y = \\alpha D + \\beta X + \\gamma Z + \\varepsilon $$\nThanks to the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem, we can simply partial-out $X$ and express the omitted variable bias in terms of $D$ and $Z$.\n$$ \\text{OVB} = \\gamma \\times \\frac{Cov(D^{\\perp X}, Z^{\\perp X})}{Var(D^{\\perp X})} $$\nwhere $D^{\\perp X}$ are the residuals from regressing $D$ on $X$ and $Z^{\\perp X}$ are the residuals from regressing $Z$ on $X$. If you are not familiar with Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem, I have written a short note here.\nChernozhukov, Cinelli, Newey, Sharma, Syrgkanis (2022) further generalize to analysis the the setting in which the control variables $X$ and the unobserved variables $Z$ enter the long model with a general functional form $f$\n$$ y = \\alpha D + f(Z, X) + \\varepsilon $$\nYou can find more details in their paper, but the underlying idea remains the same.\nExample Suppose we were a researcher interested in the relationship between education and wages. Does investing in education pay off in terms of future wages? Suppose we had data on wages for people with different years of education. Why not looking at the correlation between years of education and wages?\nThe problem is that there might be many unobserved variables that are correlated with both education and wages. For simplicity, let\u0026rsquo;s concentrate on ability. People of higher ability might decide to invest more in education just because they are better in school and they get more opportunities. On the other hand, they might also get higher wages afterwards, purely because of their innate ability.\nWe can represent the data generating process with the following Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\nflowchart TD classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; D((education)) Z((ability)) Y((wage)) X1((age)) X2((gender)) D --\u0026gt; Y Z --\u0026gt; D Z --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; Y X2 --\u0026gt; Y class D,Y included; class X1,X2 excluded; class Z unobserved;  Let\u0026rsquo;s load and inspect the data.

However, we know there might be an omitted variable bias, because we do not observe ability. In terms of DAGs, there is a backdoor path from education to wage passing through ability that is not blocked and therefore biases our estimate.\nflowchart TD classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; D((education)) Z((ability)) Y((wage)) X1((age)) X2((gender)) D --\u0026gt; Y Z --\u0026gt; D Z --\u0026gt; Y X1 --\u0026gt; Y X2 --\u0026gt; Y class D,Y included; class X1,X2 excluded; class Z unobserved; linkStyle 0 stroke:#00ff00,stroke-width:4px; linkStyle 1,2 stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:4px;  Does it mean that all our analysis is garbage? Can we still draw some causal conclusion from the regression results?\nDirection of the Bias If we knew the signs of $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$, we could infer the sign of the bias, since it\u0026rsquo;s the product of the two signs.\n$$ \\text{OVB} = \\gamma \\delta \\qquad \\text{ where } \\qquad \\gamma := \\frac{Cov(Z, y)}{Var(Z)}, \\quad \\delta := \\frac{Cov(D, Z)}{Var(D)} $$\nwhich in our example is\n$$ \\text{OVB} = \\gamma \\delta \\qquad \\text{ where } \\qquad \\gamma := \\frac{Cov(\\text{ability}, \\text{wage})}{Var(\\text{ability})}, \\quad \\delta := \\frac{Cov(\\text{education}, \\text{ability})}{Var(\\text{education})} $$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s analyze the two correlations separately:\n The correlation between ability and wage is most likely positive The correlation between ability and education is most likely positive  Therefore, the bias is most likely positive. From this, we can conclude that our estimate from the regression on wage on education is most likely an overestimate of the true effect, which is most likely smaller.\nThis might seem like a small insight, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually huge. Now we can say with confidence that one year of education increases wages by at most 95 dollars per month, which is a much more informative statement than just saying that the estimate is biased.\nIn general, we can summarize the different possible effects of the bias in a 2-by-2 table.\nFurther Sensitivity Analysis Can we say more about the omitted variable bias without making strong assumptions?\nThe answer is yes! In particular, we can ask ourselves: how strong should the partial correlations $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ be in order to overturn our conclusion?\nIn our example, we found a positive correlation between education and wages in the data. However, we know that we are omitting ability in the regression. The question is: how strong should the correlation between ability and wage, $\\gamma$, and between ability and education, $\\delta$, be in order to make the effect not significant or even negative?\nCinelli and Hazlett (2020) show that we can transform this question in terms of residual variation explained, i.e. the coefficient of determination, $R^2$. The advantage of this approach is interpretability. It is much easier to make a guess about the percentage of variance explained than to make a guess about the magnitude of a conditional correlation.\nThe authors wrote a companion package sensemakr to conduct the sensitivity analysis. You can find a detailed description of the package here.\nWe will now use the Sensemakr function. The main arguments of the Sensemakr function are:\n model: the regression model we want to analyze treatment: the feature/covariate of interest, in our case education  The question we will try to answer is the following:\n How much of the residual variation in education (x axis) and wage (y axis) does ability need to explain in order for the effect of education on wages to change sign?\n import sensemakr sensitivity = sensemakr.Sensemakr(model = short_model, treatment = \u0026quot;education\u0026quot;) sensitivity.plot() plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;Partial $R^2$ of ability with education\u0026quot;); plt.ylabel(\u0026quot;Partial $R^2$ of ability with wage\u0026quot;);  In the plot, we see how the partial (because conditional on age and gender) $R^2$ of ability with education and wage affects the estimated coefficient of education on wage. The $(0,0)$ coordinate, marked with a triangle, corresponds to the current estimate and reflects what would happen if ability had no explanatory power for both wage with education: nothing. As the explanatory power of ability grows (moving upwards and rightwards from the triangle), the estimated coefficient decreases, as marked by the level curves, until it becomes zero at the dotted red line.\nHow should we interpret the plot? We can see that we need ability to explain around 30% of the residual variation in both education and wage in order for the effect of education on wages to disappear, corresponding to the red line.\nOne question that you might (legitimately) have now is: what is 30%? Is it big or is it small? We can get a sense of the magnitude of the partial $R^2$ by benchmarking the results with the residual variance explained by another observed variable. Let\u0026rsquo;s use age for example.\nThe Sensemakr function accepts the following optional arguments:\n benchmark_covariates: the covariate to use as a benchmark kd and ky: these arguments parameterize how many times stronger the unobserved variable (ability) is related to the treatment (kd) and to the outcome (ky) in comparison to the observed benchmark covariate (age). In our example, setting kd and ky equal to $[0.5, 1, 2]$ means we want to investigate the maximum strength of a variable half, same, or twice as strong as age (in explaining education and wage variation).  sensitivity = sensemakr.Sensemakr(model = short_model, treatment = \u0026quot;education\u0026quot;, benchmark_covariates = \u0026quot;age\u0026quot;, kd = [0.5, 1, 2], ky = [0.5, 1, 2]) sensitivity.plot() plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;Partial $R^2$ of ability with education\u0026quot;); plt.ylabel(\u0026quot;Partial $R^2$ of ability with wage\u0026quot;);  It looks like even if ability had twice as much explanatory power as age, the effect of education on wage would still be positive. But would it be statistically significant?\nWe can repeat the same exercise, looking at the t-statistic instead of the magnitude of the coefficient. We just need to set the sensitivity_of option in the plotting function equal to t-value.\nThe question that we are trying to answer in this case is:\n How much of the residual variation in education (x axis) and wage (y axis) does ability need to explain in order for the effect of education on wages to become not significant?\n sensitivity.plot(sensitivity_of = 't-value') plt.xlabel(\u0026quot;Partial $R^2$ of ability with education\u0026quot;); plt.ylabel(\u0026quot;Partial $R^2$ of ability with wage\u0026quot;);  From the plot, we can see, we need ability to explain around 5% to 10% of the residual variation in both education and wage in order for the effect of education on wage not to be significant. In particular, the red line plots the level curve for the t-statistic equal to 2.01, corresponding to a 5% significance level. From the comparison with age, we see that a slightly stronger explanatory power (bigger than 1.0x age) would be sufficient to make the coefficient of education on wage not statistically significant.\nConclusion In this post, I have introduced the concept of omitted variable bias. We have seen how it\u0026rsquo;s computed in a simple linear model and how we can exploit qualitative information about the variables to make inference in presence of omitted variable bias.\nThese tools are extremely useful since omitted variable bias is essentially everywhere. First of all, there are always factors that we do not observe, such as ability in our toy example. However, even if we could observe everything, omitted variable bias can also emerge in the form of model misspecification. Suppose that wages depended on age in a quadratic way. Then, omitting the quadratic term from the regression introduces bias, which can be analyzed with the same tools we have used for ability.\nReferences [1] C. Cinelli, C.

It\u0026rsquo;s a very intuitive visualization tool that allows us to directly look at the data. However, when we have a lot of data and/or when the data is skewed, scatterplots can be too noisy to be informative.\nIn this blog post, I am going to review a very powerful alternative to the scatterplot to visualize correlations between two variables: the binned scatterplot. Binned scatterplots are not only a great visualization tool, but they can also be used to do inference on the conditional distribution of the dependent variable.\nThe Scatterplot Let\u0026rsquo;s start with an example. Suppose we are an online marketplace where multiple firms offer goods that consumer can efficiently browse, compare and buy. Our dataset consists in a snapshot of the firms active on the marketplace.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s load the data and have a look at it. You can find the code for the data generating process here.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_marketplace df = dgp_marketplace().generate_data(N=10_000) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  age sales online products     0 0.312777 450.858091 0 2   1 1.176221 1121.882449 1 3   2 1.764048 2698.714549 0 1   3 1.082742 1627.746386 0 3   4 3.156503 1464.593939 0 2     We have information on 10.000 firms. For each firm we know:\n age: the age of the firm sales: the monthly sales from last month online: whether the firm is only active online products: the number of products that the firm offers  Suppose we are interested in understanding the relationship between age and sales. What is the life-cycle of sales?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a simple scatterplot of sales over age.\nsns.scatterplot(x='age', y='sales', data=df); plt.title(\u0026quot;Sales by firm's age\u0026quot;);  The plot is extremely noisy. We have a lot of observations, therefore, it is very difficult to visualize them all. If we had to guess, we could say that the relationship looks negative (sales decrease with age), but it would be a very uninformed guess.\nWe are now going to explore some plausible tweaks and alternatives.\nScatterplot Alternatives What can we do when we have an extremely dense scatterplot? One solution could be to plot the density of the observations, instead of the observations themselves.\nThere are multiple solutions in Python to visualize the density of a 2-dimensional distribution. A very useful one is seaborn jointplot. jointplot plots the joint distribution of two variables, together with the marginal distributions along the axis. The default option is the scatterplot, but one can also choose to add a regression line (reg), change the plot to a histogram (hist), a hexplot (hex), or a kernel density estimate (kde).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try the hexplot, which is basically a histogram of the data, where the bins are hexagons, in the 2-dimensional space.\ns = sns.jointplot(x='age', y='sales', data=df, kind='hex', ); s.ax_joint.grid(False); s.ax_marg_y.grid(False); s.fig.suptitle(\u0026quot;Sales by firm's age\u0026quot;);  Not much has changed. It looks like the distributions of age and sales are both very skewed and, therefore, most of the action is concentrated in a very small subspace.\nMaybe we could remove outliers and zoom-in on the area where most of the data is located. Let\u0026rsquo;s zoom-in on the bottom-left corner, on observations what have age \u0026lt; 3 and sales \u0026lt; 3000.\ns = sns.jointplot(x='age', y='sales', data=df.query(\u0026quot;age \u0026lt; 3 \u0026amp; sales \u0026lt; 3000\u0026quot;), kind=\u0026quot;hex\u0026quot;); s.ax_joint.grid(False); s.ax_marg_y.grid(False); s.fig.suptitle(\u0026quot;Sales by firm's age\u0026quot;);  Now there is much less empty space, but it does not look like we are going far. The joint distribution is still too skewed. This is the case when the data follows some power distribution, as it\u0026rsquo;s often the case with business data.\nOne solution is to transform the variable, by taking the natural logarithm.\ndf['log_age'] = np.log(df['age']) df['log_sales'] = np.log(df['sales'])  We can now plot the relationship between the logarithms of age and sales.\ns = sns.jointplot(x='log_age', y='log_sales', data=df, kind='hex'); s.ax_joint.grid(False); s.ax_marg_y.grid(False); s.fig.suptitle(\u0026quot;Sales by firm's age\u0026quot;, y=1.02);  The logarithm definitely helped. Now the data is more spread across space, which means that the visualization is more informative. Moreover, it looks like there is no relationship between the two variables.\nHowever, there is still too much noise. Maybe data visualization alone is not sufficient do draw a conclusion.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s swap to a more structured approach: linear regression. Let\u0026rsquo;s linearly regress log_sales on log_age.\nsmf.ols('log_sales ~ log_age', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  7.3971  0.015  478.948  0.000  7.367  7.427   log_age  0.1690  0.010  16.888  0.000  0.149  0.189   The regression coefficient for log_age is positive and statistically significant (i.e. different from zero). It seems that all previous visualizations were very misleading. From none of the graphs above we could have guessed such a strong positive relationship.\nHowever, maybe this relationship is different for online-only firms and the rest of the sample. We need to control for this variable in order to avoid Simpson\u0026rsquo;s Paradox and, more generally, bias.\nWith linear regression, we can condition the analysis on covariates. Let\u0026rsquo;s add the binary indicator for online-only firms and the variable counting the number of products to the regression.\nsmf.ols('log_sales ~ log_age + online + products', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  6.5717  0.037  176.893  0.000  6.499  6.644   log_age  0.0807  0.010  7.782  0.000  0.060  0.101   online  0.1447  0.027  5.433  0.000  0.092  0.197   products  0.3456  0.014  24.110  0.000  0.317  0.374   The coefficient for log_age is still positive and statistically significant, but its magnitude has halved.\nWhat should we conclude? It seems that sales increase over age, on average. However, this pattern might be very non-linear.\nWithin the linear regression framework, one approach could be to add extra terms such as polynomials (age^2) or categorical features (e.g. age \u0026lt; 2). However, it would be really cool if there was a more flexible (i.e. non-parametric) approach that could inform us on the relationship between firm age and sales.\nIf only\u0026hellip;\nThe Binned Scatterplot The binned scatterplot is a very powerful tool that provides a flexible and parsimonious way of visualizing and summarizing conditional means (and not only) in large datasets.\nThe idea behind the binned scatterplot is to divide the conditioning variable, age in our example, into equally sized bins or quantiles, and then plot the conditional mean of the dependent variable, sales in our example, within each bin.\nDetails Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell, Feng (2021) have built an extremely good package for binned scatterplots in R, binsreg. Moreover, they have ported the package to Python. We can install binsreg directly from pip using pip install binsreg. You can find more information on the Python package here, while the original and detailed R package documentation can be found here.\nThe most important choice when building a binned scatterplot is the number of bins. The trade-off is the usual bias-variance trade-off. By picking a higher number of bins, we have more points in the graph. In the extreme, we end up having a standard scatterplot (assuming the conditioning variable is continuous). On the other hand, by decreasing the number bins, the plot will be more stable. However, in the extreme, we will have a single point representing the sample mean.\nCattaneo, Crump, Farrell, Feng (2021) prove that, in the basic binned scatterplot, the number of bins that minimizes the mean squared error is proportional to $n^{1/3}$, where $n$ is the number of observations. Therefore, in general, more observations lead to more bins.\nStarr and Goldfarb (2020) add the following consideration:\n \u0026ldquo;However other elements are also important. For example, holding the distribution of x constant, the more curvilinear the true relationship between x and y is, the more bins the algorithm will select (otherwise mean squared error will increase). This implies that even with large n, few bins will be chosen for relatively flat relationships. The calculation of the optimal number of bins in a basic binned scatterplot thus takes into account the amount and location of variation in the data available to identify the relationship between x and y.\u0026rdquo;\n It is strongly recommended to use the default optimal number of bins. However, one can also set a customized number of bins in binsreg with the nbins option.\nBinned scatterplots however, do not just compute conditional means, for optimally chosen intervals, but they can also provide inference for these means. In particular, we can build confidence intervals around each data point. In the binsreg package, the option ci adds confidence intervals to the estimation results. The option takes as input a tuple of parameters (p, s) and uses a piecewise polynomial of degree p with s smoothness constraints to construct the confidence intervals. By default, the confidence intervals are not included in the plot. For what concerns the choice of p and s, the package documentation reports:\n \u0026ldquo;Recommended specification is ci=c(3,3), which adds confidence intervals based on cubic B-spline estimate of the regression function of interest to the binned scatter plot.\u0026rdquo;\n Binsreg One problem with the Python version of the package, is that is not very Python-ish. Therefore, I have wrapped the binsreg package into a function binscatter that takes care of cleaning and formatting the output in a nicely readable Pandas DataFrame.\nimport binsreg def binscatter(**kwargs): # Estimate binsreg est = binsreg.binsreg(**kwargs) # Retrieve estimates df_est = pd.concat([d.dots for d in est.data_plot]) df_est = df_est.rename(columns={'x': kwargs.get(\u0026quot;x\u0026quot;), 'fit': kwargs.get(\u0026quot;y\u0026quot;)}) # Add confidence intervals if \u0026quot;ci\u0026quot; in kwargs: df_est = pd.merge(df_est, pd.concat([d.ci for d in est.data_plot])) df_est = df_est.drop(columns=['x']) df_est['ci'] = df_est['ci_r'] - df_est['ci_l'] # Rename groups if \u0026quot;by\u0026quot; in kwargs: df_est['group'] = df_est['group'].astype(df[kwargs.get(\u0026quot;by\u0026quot;)].dtype) df_est = df_est.rename(columns={'group': kwargs.get(\u0026quot;by\u0026quot;)}) return df_est  We can now proceed to estimate and visualize the binned scatterplot for age based on sales.\n# Estimate binsreg df_est = binscatter(x='age', y='sales', data=df, ci=(3,3)) df_est.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  group age bin isknot mid sales ci_l ci_r ci     0 Full Sample 0.012556 0 0 0 1624.779616 1312.439124 1905.535412 593.096288   1 Full Sample 0.037015 1 0 0 1664.078013 1435.438411 1893.888819 458.450408   2 Full Sample 0.065813 2 0 0 1779.657894 1555.909281 1968.681960 412.772679   3 Full Sample 0.094486 3 0 0 1976.464837 1740.530049 2216.800005 476.269956   4 Full Sample 0.125363 4 0 0 2015.833752 1796.489393 2280.237320 483.747927     The binscatter function outputs a dataset in which, for each bin of the conditioning variable, age, we have values and confidence intervals for the outcome variable, sales.\nWe can now plot the estimates.\n# Plot binned scatterplot sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='sales', data=df_est); plt.errorbar('age', 'sales', yerr='ci', data=df_est, ls='', lw=3, alpha=0.2); plt.title(\u0026quot;Sales by firm's age\u0026quot;);  The plot is quite revealing. Now the relationship looks extremely non-linear with a sharp increase in sales at the beginning of the lifetime of a firm, followed by a plateau.\nMoreover, the plot is also telling us information regarding the distributions of age and sales. In fact, the plot is more dense on the left, where the distribution of age is concentrated. Also, confidence intervals are tighter on the left, where most of the conditional distribution of sales lies.\nAs we already discussed in the previous section, it might be important to control for other variables. For example, the number of products, since firms that sell more products probably survive longer in the markets and also make more sales.\nbinsreg allows to condition the analysis on any number of variables, with the w option.\n# Estimate binsreg df_est = binscatter(x='age', y='sales', w=['products'], data=df, ci=(3,3)) # Plot binned scatterplot sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='sales', data=df_est); plt.errorbar('age', 'sales', yerr='ci', data=df_est, ls='', lw=3, alpha=0.2); plt.title(\u0026quot;Sales by firm's age\u0026quot;);  Conditional on number of products, the shape of the sales life-cycle changes further. Now, after an initial increase in sales, we observe a gradual decrease over time.\nDo online-only firms have different sales life-cycles with respect to mixed online-offline firms? We can produce different binned scatterplots by group using the option by.\n# Estimate binsreg df_est = binscatter(x='age', y='sales', by='online', w=['products'], data=df, ci=(3,3)) # Plot binned scatterplot sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='sales', data=df_est, hue='online'); plt.errorbar('age', 'sales', yerr='ci', data=df_est.query(\u0026quot;online==0\u0026quot;), ls='', lw=3, alpha=0.2); plt.errorbar('age', 'sales', yerr='ci', data=df_est.query(\u0026quot;online==1\u0026quot;), ls='', lw=3, alpha=0.2); plt.title(\u0026quot;Sales by firm's age\u0026quot;);  From the binned scatterplot, we can see that online products have on average shorter lifetimes, with a higher initial peak in sales, followed by a sharper decline.\nConclusion In this blog post, we have analyzed a very powerful data visualization tool: the binned scatterplot. In particular, we have seen how to use the binsreg package to automatically pick the optimal number of bins and perform non-parametric inference on conditional means.

This is extremely useful when we are interested in the relationship between two variables, but we still need to control for other factors, as it is often the case in causal inference.\nIn this blog post, I am going to introduce the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem and illustrate some interesting applications.\nThe Theorem The theorem was first published by Ragnar Frisch and Frederick Waugh in 1933. However, since its proof was lengthy and cumbersome, Michael Lovell in 1963 provided a very simple and intuitive proof and his name was added to the theorem name.\nThe theorem states that, when estimating a model of the form\n$$ y_i = \\beta_1 x_{i,1} + \\beta_2 x_{i,2} + \\varepsilon_i $$\nthen, the following estimators of $\\beta_1$ are equivalent:\n the OLS estimator obtained by regressing $y$ on $x_1$ and $x_2$ the OLS estimator obtained by regressing $y$ on $\\tilde x_1$  where $\\tilde x_1$ is the residual from the regression of $x_1$ on $x_2$   the OLS estimator obtained by regressing $\\tilde y$ on $\\tilde x_1$  where $\\tilde y$ is the residual from the regression of $y$ on $x_2$    Interpretation What did we actually learn?\nThe Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem is telling us that there are multiple ways to estimate a single regression coefficient. One possibility is to run the full regression of $y$ on $x$, as usual.\nHowever, we can also regress $x_1$ on $x_2$, take the residuals, and regress $y$ only those residuals. The first part of this process is sometimes referred to as partialling-out (or orthogonalization, or residualization) of $x_1$ with respect to $x_2$. The idea is that we are isolating the variation in $x_1$ that is orthogonal to $x_2$. Note that $x_2$ can be also be multi-dimensional (i.e. include multiple variables and not just one).\nWhy would one ever do that?\nThis seems like a way more complicated procedure. Instead of simply doing the regression in 1 step, now we need to do 2 or even 3 steps. It\u0026rsquo;s not intuitive at all. The main advantage comes from the fact that we have reduced a multivariate regression to a univariate one, making more tractable and more intuitive.\nWe will later explore more in detail three applications:\n data visualization computational speed further applications for inference  However, let\u0026rsquo;s first explore the theorem more in detail with an example.\nExample Suppose we were a retail chain, owning many different stores in different locations. We come up with a brilliant idea to increase sales: give away discounts in the form of coupons. We print a lot of coupons and we distribute them around.\nTo understand whether our marketing strategy worked, in each store, we check the average daily sales and which percentage of shoppers used a coupon. However, there is one problem: we are worried that higher income people are less likely to use the discount, but usually they spend more. To be safe, we also record the average income in the neighborhood of each store.\nWe can represent the data generating process with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If you are not familiar with DAGs, I have written a short introduction to Directed Acyclic Graphs here.\nflowchart LR classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; X1((coupons)) X2((income)) X3((weekday)) Y((sales)) X1 --\u0026gt; Y X2 --\u0026gt; X1 X2 --\u0026gt; Y X3 --\u0026gt; Y class X1,X2,X3,Y excluded;  Let\u0026rsquo;s load and inspect the data. I import the data generating process from src.dgp and some plotting functions and libraries from src.utils.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_store_coupons df = dgp_store_coupons().generate_data(N=50) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  sales coupons income dayofweek     0 821.7 0.199 66.243 2   1 602.3 0.245 43.882 3   2 655.1 0.162 44.718 5   3 625.8 0.269 39.270 4   4 696.6 0.186 58.654 1     We have information on 50 stores, for which we observe the percentage of customers that use coupons, daily sales (in thousand $), average income of the neighborhood (in thousand $), and day of the week.\nSuppose we were directly regressing sales on coupon usage. What would we get? I represent the result of the regression graphically, using seaborn regplot.\nsns.regplot(x=\u0026quot;coupons\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;sales\u0026quot;, data=df, ci=False, line_kws={'color':'r', 'label':'linear fit'}) plt.legend() plt.title(f\u0026quot;Sales and coupon usage\u0026quot;);  It looks like coupons were a bad idea: in stores where coupons are used more, we observe lower sales.\nHowever, it might just be that people with higher income are using less coupons, while also spending more. If this was true, it could bias our results. In terms of the DAG, it means that we have a backdoor path passing through income, generating a non-causal relationship.\nflowchart LR classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef unobserved fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5; X1((coupons)) X2((income)) X3((weekday)) Y((sales)) X1 --\u0026gt; Y X2 --\u0026gt; X1 X2 --\u0026gt; Y X3 --\u0026gt; Y class X1,Y included; class X2,X3 excluded; linkStyle 1,2 stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:4px;  In order to recover the causal effect of coupons on sales we need to condition our analysis on income.

Coupons were actually a good idea after all.\nVerifying the Theorem Let\u0026rsquo;s now verify that the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem actually holds. In particular, we want to check whether we get the same coefficient if, instead of regressing sales on coupons and income, we were\n regressing coupons on income computing the residuals coupons_tilde, i.e. the variation in coupons not explained by income regressing sales on coupons_tilde  df['coupons_tilde'] = smf.ols('coupons ~ income', df).fit().resid smf.ols('sales ~ coupons_tilde - 1', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   coupons_tilde  218.7548  1275.236  0.172  0.865 -2343.929  2781.438   Yes, the coefficient is the same! However, the standard errors now have increased a lot and the estimated coefficient is not significantly different from zero anymore.\nA better approach is to add a further step and repeat the same procedure also for sales:\n regressing sales on income computing the residuals sales_tilde, i.e. the variation in sales not explained by income  and finally regress sales_tilde on coupons_tilde.\ndf['sales_tilde'] = smf.ols('sales ~ income', df).fit().resid smf.ols('sales_tilde ~ coupons_tilde - 1', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   coupons_tilde  218.7548  49.025  4.462  0.000  120.235  317.275   The coefficient is still exactly the same, but now also the standard errors are almost identical.\nProjection What is partialling-out (or residualization, or orthogonalization) actually doing? What is happening when we take the residuals of coupons with respect to income?\nWe can visualize the procedure in a plot. First, let\u0026rsquo;s actually display the residuals of coupons with respect to income.\ndf[\u0026quot;coupons_hat\u0026quot;] = smf.ols('coupons ~ income', df).fit().predict() ax = sns.regplot(x=\u0026quot;income\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;coupons\u0026quot;, data=df, ci=False, line_kws={'color':'r', 'label':'linear fit'}) ax.vlines(df[\u0026quot;income\u0026quot;], np.minimum(df[\u0026quot;coupons\u0026quot;], df[\u0026quot;coupons_hat\u0026quot;]), np.maximum(df[\u0026quot;coupons\u0026quot;], df[\u0026quot;coupons_hat\u0026quot;]), linestyle='--', color='k', alpha=0.5, linewidth=1, label=\u0026quot;residuals\u0026quot;); plt.legend() plt.title(f\u0026quot;Coupons usage, income and residuals\u0026quot;);  The residuals are the vertical dotted lines between the data and the linear fit, i.e. the part of the variation in coupons unexplained by income.\nBy partialling-out, we are removing the linear fit from the data and keeping only the residuals. We can visualize this procedure with a gif. I import the code from the src.figures file that you can find here.\nfrom src.figures import gif_projection gif_projection(x='income', y='coupons', df=df, gifname=\u0026quot;gifs/fwl.gif\u0026quot;)  The original distribution of the data is on the left in blue, the partialled-out data in on the right in green. As we can see, partialling-out removes both the level and the trend in coupons that is explained by income.\nMultiple Controls We can use the Frisch-Waugh-Theorem also when we have multiple control variables. Suppose that we wanted to also include day of the week in the regression, to increase precision.\nsmf.ols('sales ~ coupons + income + dayofweek', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  124.2721  28.764  4.320  0.000  66.182  182.362   dayofweek[T.2]  7.7703  14.607  0.532  0.598  -21.729  37.270   dayofweek[T.3]  15.0895  11.678  1.292  0.204  -8.495  38.674   dayofweek[T.4]  28.2762  9.868  2.866  0.007  8.348  48.204   dayofweek[T.5]  44.0937  10.214  4.317  0.000  23.467  64.720   dayofweek[T.6]  50.7664  13.130  3.866  0.000  24.249  77.283   dayofweek[T.7]  57.3142  12.413  4.617  0.000  32.245  82.383   coupons  192.0262  39.140  4.906  0.000  112.981  271.071   income  9.8152  0.404  24.314  0.000  9.000  10.630   We can perform the same procedure as before, but instead of partialling-out only income, now we partial out both income and day of the week.\ndf['coupons_tilde'] = smf.ols('coupons ~ income + dayofweek', df).fit().resid df['sales_tilde'] = smf.ols('sales ~ income + dayofweek', df).fit().resid smf.ols('sales_tilde ~ coupons_tilde - 1', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   coupons_tilde  192.0262  35.803  5.363  0.000  120.078  263.974   We still get exactly the same coefficient!\nApplications Let\u0026rsquo;s now inspect some useful applications of the FWL theorem.\nData Visualization One of the advantages of the Frisch-Waugh-Theorem is that it allows us to estimate the coefficient of interest from a univariate regression, i.e. with a single explanatory variable (or feature).\nTherefore, we can now represent the relationship of interest graphically. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the residual sales against the residual coupons.\nsns.regplot(x=\u0026quot;coupons_tilde\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;sales_tilde\u0026quot;, data=df, ci=False, line_kws={'color':'r', 'label':'linear fit'}) plt.legend() plt.title(f\u0026quot;Residual sales and residual coupons\u0026quot;);  Now it\u0026rsquo;s evident from the graph that the conditional relationship between sales and coupons is positive.\nOne problem with this approach is that the variables are hard to interpret: we now have negative values for both sales and coupons. Weird.\nWhy did it happen? It happened because when we partialled-out the variables, we included the intercept in the regression, effectively de-meaning the variables (i.e. normalizing their values so that their mean is zero).\nWe can solve this problem by scaling both variables, adding their mean.\ndf['coupons_tilde_scaled'] = df['coupons_tilde'] + np.mean(df['coupons']) df['sales_tilde_scaled'] = df['sales_tilde'] + np.mean(df['sales'])  Now the magnitudes of the two variables are interpretable again.\nsns.regplot(x=\u0026quot;coupons_tilde_scaled\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;sales_tilde_scaled\u0026quot;, data=df, ci=False, line_kws={'color':'r', 'label':'linear fit'}) plt.legend() plt.title(f\u0026quot;Residual sales scaled and residual coupons scaled\u0026quot;);  Is this a valid approach or did it alter our estimates? We can can check it by running the regression with the scaled partialled-out variables.\nsmf.ols('sales_tilde_scaled ~ coupons_tilde_scaled', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  641.6486  10.017  64.054  0.000  621.507  661.790   coupons_tilde_scaled  192.0262  36.174  5.308  0.000  119.294  264.758   The coefficient is exactly the same as before!\nComputational Speed Another application of the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem is to increase the computational speed of linear estimators. For example it is used to compute efficient linear estimators in presence of high-dimensional fixed effects (day of the week in our example).\nSome packages that exploit the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem include\n reghdfe in Stata pyhdfe in Python  However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to also mention the fixest package in R, which is also exceptionally efficient in running regressions with high dimensional fixed effects.\nInference and Machine Learning Another important application of the FWL theorem sits at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference. I am referring to the work on post-double selection by Belloni, Chernozhukov, Hansen (2013) and the follow up work on \u0026ldquo;double machine learning\u0026rdquo; by Chernozhukov, Chetverikov, Demirer, Duflo, Hansen, Newey, Robins (2018).\nI plan to cover both applications in future posts, but I wanted to start with the basics.

For example, if you want to understand the effect of having a tablet in class on studenta' performance, it makes sense to compare schools where students have similar socio-economic backgrounds. Otherwise, the risk is that only wealthier students can afford a tablet and, without controlling for it, we might attribute the effect to tablets instead of the socio-economic background.\nWhen the treatment of interest comes from a proper randomized experiment, we do not need to worry about conditioning on other variables. If tablets are distributed randomly across schools, and we have enough schools in the experiment, we do not have to worry about the socio-economic background of students. The only advantage of conditioning the analysis on some so-called \u0026ldquo;control variable\u0026rdquo; could be an increase in power. However, this is a different story.\nIn this post, we are going to have a brief introduction to Directed Acyclic Graphs and how they can be useful to select variables to condition a causal analysis on. Not only DAGs provide visual intuition on which variables we need to include in the analysis, but also on which variables we should not include, and why.\nDirected Acyclic Graphs Definitions Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a visual representation of the data generating process. Random variables are represented with letters (e.g. $X$) and causal relationships are represented with arrows (e.g. $\\to$). For example, we interpret\nflowchart LR classDef white fill:#FFFFFF,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px X((X)):::white --\u0026gt; Y((Y)):::white  as $X$ (possibly) causes $Y$. We call a path between two variables $X$ and $Y$ any connection, independently of the direction of the arrows. If all arrows point forward, we call it a causal path, otherwise we call it a spurious path.\nflowchart LR classDef included fill:#DCDCDC,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; classDef excluded fill:#ffffff,stroke:#000000,stroke-width:2px; X((X)) Y((Y)) Z1((Z1)) Z2((Z2)) Z3((Z3)) X --\u0026gt; Z1 Z1 --\u0026gt; Z2 Z3 --\u0026gt; Z2 Z3 --\u0026gt; Y class X,Y included; class Z1,Z2,Z3 excluded;  In the example above, we have a path between $X$ and $Y$ passing through the variables $Z_1$, $Z_2$, and $Z_3$. Since not all arrows point forward, the path is spurious and there is no causal relationship of $X$ on $Y$. In fact, variable $Z_2$ is caused by both $Z_1$ and $Z_3$ and therefore blocks the path.\n$Z_2$ is called a collider.\nThe purpose of our analysis is to assess the causal relationship between two variables $X$ and $Y$. Directed acyclic graphs are useful because they provide us instructions on which other variables $Z$ we need to condition our analysis on. Conditioning the analysis on a variable means that we keep it fixed and we draw our conclusions ceteris paribus. For example, in a linear regression framework, inserting another regressor $Z$ means that we are computing the best linear approximation of the conditional expectation function of $Y$ given $X$, conditional on the observed values of $Z$.\nCausality In order to assess causality, we want to close all spurious paths between $X$ and $Y$. The questions now are:\n When is a path open?  If it does not contain colliders. Otherwise, it is closed.   How do you close an open path?  You condition on at least one intermediate variable.   How do you open a closed path?  You condition on all colliders along the path.    Suppose we are again interested in the causal relationship of $X$ on $Y$.

DAGs are very helpful tools since they provide an intuitive graphical representation of causal relationships between random variables. Contrary to common intuition that \u0026ldquo;the more information the better\u0026rdquo;, sometimes including extra variables might bias the analysis, preventing a causal interpretation of the results. In particular, we must pay attention not to include colliders that open spurious paths that would otherwise be closed.\nReferences [1] C. Cinelli, A. Forney, J.

After (too many) hours of research, I decided to build it using Hugo, and I picked the Wowchemy theme, also known as Hugo Academic. In this tutorial, I am going to share my guide to building a website on Github Pages so that you don’t have to go through all the pain I went through 😁.\nBefore we start, I have to warn you. If you don’t care about personalization or if you have very little time to spend on building a website, I strongly recommend Google Sites, which is, in my opinion, the fastest and easiest way to build an academic website. However, if you enjoy customizing your website, or if you like my template, then this guide might be useful.\nAlso, note that Hugo offers many other website templates. I suggest checking them out. Some interesting alternatives are:\n Resume Somrat UILite (paid)  However, in this guide, I will concentrate on the Hugo Academic theme, since it’s the one I used for my website and I believe it’s the best one for building academic profile pages. But the first part of this guide is general and it works for any Hugo theme.\nCreate Website 0. Prerequisites Before we start, I will take for granted the following:\n that you have an account on Github that you have R installed that you have RStudio installed  1. Create Github Repository First, go to your Github page and create a new repository (+ button in the top-right corner).\nName the repository username.github.io where username is your Github username.\nIn my case, my github username is matteocourthoud, therefore the repository is matteocourthoud.github.io and my personal website is https://matteocourthoud.github.io. Use the default settings when creating the repository.\n2. Install Blogdown and Hugo Now you need to install Blogdown, which is the program what will allow you to build and deploy your website, and Hugo, which is the template generator.\nSwitch to RStudio and type the following commands\n# Install blogdown install.packages(\u0026quot;blogdown\u0026quot;) # Install Hugo blogdown::install_hugo()  Now everything should be ready!\n3. Setup folder Open RStudio and select New Project.\nSelect New Directory when asked where to create the project.\nThen select Website using blogdown as project type.\nNow you have to select a couple of options:\n Directory name: here input the name of the folder which will contain all the website files. The name is irrelevant. I called mine website. Create project as a subdirectory of: select the directory in which you want to put the website folder. Theme: input wowchemy/starter-academic instead of the default theme.  Note: if you want to install a different theme, just go on the corresponding Github page (for example https://github.com/caressofsteel/hugo-story) and instead of gcushen/hugo-academic, insert the corresponding Github repository (for example caressofsteel/hugo-story).\nIf you go into the website folder, it should look something like\n4. Build website To build the website, open the RProject file website.Rproj in RStudio and type\nblogdown::hugo_build(local=TRUE)  This command will generate a public/ subfolder in which the actual code of the website is stored.\nDon’t ask me why, but the option local=TRUE seems to make a difference. Updating without it sometimes does not change the content in the public/ subfolder.\nTo preview the website, type in RStudio\nblogdown::serve_site()  The following preview should automatically open in your browser.\nPreviewing the website is very useful as it allows you to see live changes locally inside RStudio, before publishing them. This is the main advantage of working in RStudio.\nIf the preview does not automatically open in your browser, and instead it previews inside RStudio Viewer panel, you can preview it in your browser using the upper left right-most button.\n5. Publish website Importantly, before pushing the code online, you need to open the file config.yaml and change the baseurl to your future website url, which will be https://username.github.io/, where username is your Github username.\nNow that you have set the correct url, you have to push the changes from the public/ folder to your username.github.io repository on Github.\nTo do that, you need to get to the website folder. Let’s assume that the path to your folder is Documents/website. Open the Terminal and type\ncd Documents/website/public  The following code will link the public/ folder, containing the actual code of the website, to your username.github.io repository.\n# Init git in the /website/public/ folder git init # Add and commit the changes git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;first version of the website\u0026quot; # Set origin git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git # Rename local branch git branch -M main # And push your updates online git push -u origin main  Wait a few seconds (or minutes for heavy changes) and your website should be online!\nIf the website is not working, you can check the following:\n Is there anything in your public/ folder? (does it even exist?) If not, something went wrong when compiling the website with blogdown::hugo_build(). Inside your public/ folder, there should be an index.html file. If you double-click on it, you should see a local preview of your website in your browser. If not, something in the website code is wrong. Is the content of your public/ folder exactly the same as the content of your Github repository? If not, something went wrong when pushing to Github. Did you name your Github repository username.github.io, where username is your Github username? Did you change the baseurl option in the file config.yaml to https://username.github.io/, where username is your Github username? You can check the list of websites deployments at https://github.com/username/username.github.io/deployments. Control that they correspond with your commits.  If all the conditions are satisfied, but the website is still not online, maybe it’s just a matter of time. Have some patience.\nBasic Customization The basic files that you want to modify to customize your website are the following:\n config/_default/config.yaml: general website information config/_default/params.yaml: website customization config/_default/menus.yaml: top bar / menu customization content/authors/admin/_index.md: personal information  For what concerns images, there are two main things you might want to modify:\n Profile picture: change the content/authors/admin/avatar.jpg picture Website icon: change the assets/media/icon.png picture  In order to modify the widgets on your homepage, go to content/home/ and modify the files inside. If you want to remove a section, just open the corresponding file and select active: false. If there is no active option, just copy the line active: false in the corresponding file.\nOn my website, I have only the following sections set to true:\n about projects posts contact  To change the color palette of the website, go to data\\theme and generate a custom_theme.toml file with the following content:\n# Theme metadata name = \u0026quot;My custom theme\u0026quot; # Is theme light or dark? light = true # Primary primary = \u0026quot;#284f7a\u0026quot; # Menu menu_primary = \u0026quot;#fff\u0026quot; menu_text = \u0026quot;#34495e\u0026quot; menu_text_active = \u0026quot;#284f7a\u0026quot; menu_title = \u0026quot;#2b2b2b\u0026quot; # Home sections home_section_odd = \u0026quot;rgb(255, 255, 255)\u0026quot; home_section_even = \u0026quot;rgb(247, 247, 247)\u0026quot; [dark] link = \u0026quot;#bbdefb\u0026quot; link_hover = \u0026quot;#bbdefb\u0026quot;  Then go to the config/_default/params.yaml file and set the theme to custom_theme.\nYou can get more information on how to personalize it here.\nTo change the font, go to data\\fonts and generate a custom_font.toml file with the following content:\n# Font style metadata name = \u0026quot;My custom font\u0026quot; # Optional Google font URL google_fonts = \u0026quot;family=Roboto+Mono\u0026amp;family=Source+Sans+Pro:wght@200;300;400;700\u0026quot; # Font families heading_font = \u0026quot;Source Sans Pro\u0026quot; body_font = \u0026quot;Source Sans Pro\u0026quot; nav_font = \u0026quot;Source Sans Pro\u0026quot; mono_font = \u0026quot;Roboto Mono\u0026quot;  Then go to the config/_default/params.yaml file and set the font to custom_font.\nYou can get more information on how to personalize it here. Importantly, by default, the website supports only fonts of weight 400 and 700. If you want a lighter font, like the Source Sans Pro I use for my website, you have to dig into the advanced customization (which requires HTML and CSS skills).\nAdvanced Customization Advanced customization is possible but it’s a pain. You basically want to go inside themes\\github.com\\wowchemy\\wowchemy-hugo-modules\\wowchemy and start digging. Tip: you want to start digging in the following places:\n In layouts\\partials to edit the HTML files In assets\\scss to edit the SCSS code  If you want to copy my exact theme, I have published my custom theme here: https://github.com/matteocourthoud/custom-wowchemy-settings\nYou have to do the following:\n go inside the theme folder copy the content of the custom-wowchemy-theme repository in a folder there go to the config.yaml file into the MODULES section   change the second link to the folder with the custom settings  Now your website should look quite similar to mine! :)\nExamples Here are some examples of advanced customizations you can do. For all the examples the baseline directory is you theme directory, themes/custom-wowchemy-theme if you renamed it as in the previous paragraph.\nExample 1\nWhat to have your section titles fixed on top of the screen?\n  Go to assets/scss/wowchemy/widgets/_base.scss\n  Search for .section-heading h1\n  It should look like this\n  Add a couple of lines as follows\n  Now the section titles should stay anchored at the top of the page\n  Example 2\nDo you want to put a background image in your home page?\n  Put the selected background image, for example image.png, into the static/img folder (the location itself does not matter)\n  Go to assets/scss/wowchemy/widgets/_about.scss\n  Add the following lines anywhere in the code\n  Now go to layouts/partials/widgets/about.html\n  Add the following lines after \u0026lt;!-- About widget --\u0026gt;\n`\n  Now image.png should appear as background image in your homepage.\n  Google Analytics In order for the website to be displayed in Google searches, you need to ask Google to track it.\n Go to the Google Search Console website Use the URL Inspection tool to inspect the URL of your personal website: https://username.github.io Use Request indexing to request Google to index your website so that it will apprear in Google searches. Under Sitemap provide the link to your website sitemap to Google. It should be https://username.github.io/sitemap.xml.  In order to receive statistics on your website, you first need to get your associated tracking code.\n Go to the Google Analytics website Click Admin Select an account from the menu in the ACCOUNT column. Select a property from the menu in the PROPERTY column. Under PROPERTY, click Tracking Info \u0026gt; Tracking Code. Your tracking ID and property number are displayed at the top of the page. It should have the form UA-xxxxxxxxx-1  Now that we have the website tracking code, we need to insert it into the googleAnalytics section of the config/_default/params.yaml file.\nmarketing: google_analytics: 'UA-xxxxxxxxx-1'  The mobile application of Google Analytics is particular intuitive and allows you to monitor your website traffic in detail. You just need to link the website from the Google Sesarch Console and then you can motitor you website from this platform. There is also a very nice mobile app for both Android and iOS to monitor your website from your smartphone.\nAnother good free tool to analyze the “quality” of your website is SEO Mechanic.\nReferences Here are the main resources I used to write this guide:\n Wowchemy website: https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/ Old Academic website: https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/ Guide for the Terminal: https://github.com/fliptanedo/FlipWebsite2017  ","date":1650240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650240000,"objectID":"50c5f0366dd809632c0e255ee6d27271","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/post/website/","publishdate":"2022-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/website/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction During the second year of my PhD, I decided that I wanted to have a personal website.

While the individual estimates are going to be inaccurate, within each leaf, we can estimate heterogeneous treatment effects.\nIn order to get an unbiased estimate however, we need to use different data to build the tree and to estimate the effect. This procedure comes at the cost of increased variance.\nExample 1: Simulated Data Let\u0026rsquo;s start with an example on synthetic data. We have the following individual characteristics:\n male: gender black: race age: age educ: education, which depends on age and race  Moreover, we maketreatment status D depend on both gender and race so that it will be important to condition on observables.\nOur outcome variable y depends on the treatment assignment differently according to education and age.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_ad  We generate a dataset out of our DGP.\ndgp = dgp_ad() df = dgp.generate_data() df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  male black age educ ad_exposure revenue     0 0 0 55.0 1 False -0.327221   1 1 1 47.0 2 False 0.659393   2 0 1 31.0 2 True 2.805178   3 0 1 51.0 2 False -0.508548   4 0 0 48.0 0 True 0.762280     We can check the distribution of variables across treatment assignment.\ndf.groupby(dgp.T).agg(['mean', 'std']).T.unstack(1)   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead tr th { text-align: left; }  \n  ad_exposure False True    mean std mean std     male 0.42000 0.494053 0.592000 0.491955   black 0.58800 0.492688 0.470000 0.499599   age 44.57600 10.350386 44.970000 9.961102   educ 2.19200 1.824773 1.968000 1.724216   revenue -0.11697 1.057941 1.156387 2.147342     As we can see, male and black are now balanced across groups.\nWe can get a first estimate of the average treatment effect as a simple comparison of means.\ndf.loc[df[dgp.T]==1, dgp.Y].mean() - df.loc[df[dgp.T]==0, dgp.Y].mean()  1.2733576182695898  We can visualize the difference with a barplot.\nsns.barplot(x=dgp.T, y=dgp.Y, data=df);  It seems there is a significant difference between the two groups.

The authors study the effect of a minimum wage policy in New Jersey on emplyment, by using Pennsylvania as a control state.\nBusiness Case\nAs a business case, we are going to study a firm that has run a TV ad campaign. The firm would like to understand the impact of the campaign on revenue and has randomized the campaign over municipalities.\nSetting We assume that for a set of i.i.d. subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ over $T$ time periods $t = 1 , \u0026hellip; , T$, we observed a tuple $(X_{it}, D_{it}, Y_{it})$ comprised of\n a feature vector $X_{it} \\in \\mathbb R^{p}$ a treatment assignment $D_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ a response $Y_{it} \\in \\mathbb R$  We assume that treatment occurs between time $t=0$ and time $t=1$.\nAssumption 1: parallel trends\nIn the absence of treatment, the outcome $Y_{it}$ evolve in parallel across units, i.e. and their $\\gamma_{t}$ are the same.\n$$ Y_{it}^{(0)} - Y_{j,t}^{(0)} = \\alpha \\quad \\forall \\ t $$\nDiff-in-diffs In this setting, we cannot estimate any causal parameter with any other further assumption. What is the minimal number of assumptions that we could make in order to estimate a causal parameter?\nIf we were to assume that treatment was randomly assigned, we could retrieve the average treatment effect as a difference in means.\n$$ \\mathbb E[\\tau_t] = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_{it} \\ \\big| \\ D_i = 1 \\big] - \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_{it} \\big| \\ D_i = 0 \\big] $$\nHowever, it would be a very strong assumption, and it would ignore some information that we possess: the time dimension (pre-post).\nIf we were to assume instead that no other shocks affected the treated units between period $t=0$ and $t=1$, we could retrieve the average treatment effect on the treated as a pre-post difference.\n$$ \\mathbb E[\\tau | D_i=1] = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_{i1} \\ \\big| \\ D_i = 1 \\big] - \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_{i0} \\ \\big| \\ D_i = 1 \\big] $$\nHowever, it also this would be a very strong assumption, and it would ignore the fact that we have control units.\nCan we make less stringent assumption and still recover a causal parameter using both the availability of a (non-random) control group and the time dimension?\nDiD Model The model that is commonly assumed in diff-ind-diff settings, is the following\n$$ Y_{it} (D_{it}) = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\tau_{i} D_{it} $$\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s summarize the potential outcome values $Y^{(d)}_{it}$ in the simple $2 \\times 2$ setting.\n    $t=0$ $t=1$     $D=0$ $\\gamma_0 + \\alpha_i$ $\\gamma_1 + \\alpha_i$   $D=1$ $\\gamma_0 + \\alpha_i + \\tau_i$ $\\gamma_1 + \\alpha_i + \\tau_i$    For a single unit, $i$, the pre-post outcome difference is given by\n$$ Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} = (\\gamma_1 - \\gamma_0) + \\tau_i (D_{i1} - D_{i0}) $$\nIf we take the difference of the expression above between treated and untreated units, we get\n$$ \\mathbb E \\Big[ Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} \\ \\Big| \\ D_{i1} - D_{i0} = 1 \\Big] - \\mathbb E \\Big[ Y_{i1} - Y_{i0} \\ \\Big| \\ D_{i1} - D_{i0} = 0 \\Big] = \\mathbb E \\Big[ \\tau_i \\ \\Big| \\ D_{i1} - D_{i0} = 1 \\Big] = ATT $$\nwhich is the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).\nWe can get this double difference with the folowing regressio model\n$$ Y_{it} (D_{it}) = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\beta D_{it} + \\varepsilon_{it} $$\nwhere the OLS estimator $\\hat \\beta$ will be unbiased for the ATT.\nMultiple Time Periods What if we didn\u0026rsquo;t just have one pre-treatment period and one post-treatment period? Great! We can actually do more things.\n We can partially test assumptions We can estimate dynamic effects We can run placebo tests  How do we implement it? Run a regression with multiple interactions\n$$ Y_{it} (D_{it}) = \\alpha_{i} + \\gamma_{t} + \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\beta_t D_{it} + \\varepsilon_{it} $$\nComments Parametric Assumption\nThe diff-in-diffs method makes a lot of parametric assumptions that are is easy to forget.\nInference\nBertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004) point out that conventional robust standard errors usually overestimate the actual standard deviation of the estimator. The authors recommend clustering the standard errors at the level of randomization (e.g. classes, counties, villages, \u0026hellip;).\nTesting pre-trends\nHaving multiple pre-treatment time periods is helpful for testing the parallel trends assumption. However, this practice can lead to pre-testing bias. In particular, if one selects results based on a pre-treatment parallel trend test, inference on the ATT gets distorderd.\nAcademic Application As an academic application, we are going to replicate Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (1994) by Card and Krueger. The authors study the effect of a minimum wage policy in New Jersey on emplyment, by using Pennsylvania as a control state.\nThe authors describe the setting as follows\n On April 1, 1992, New Jersey\u0026rsquo;s minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. To evaluate the impact of the law, the authors surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after the rise. Comparisons of employment growth at stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage was constant) provide simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s start by loading and inspecting the data.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import *  from src.data import import_ck94 df = pd.read_csv('data/ck94.csv') df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  id after new_jersey chain employment hrsopen wage     0 3 0 0 wendys 34.0 12.0 5.00   1 4 0 0 wendys 24.0 12.0 5.50   2 6 0 0 burgerking 70.5 18.0 5.00   3 7 0 0 burgerking 23.5 24.0 5.00   4 8 0 0 kfc 11.0 10.0 5.25     We have information on fast food restaurants, indexed by i, at time t.

The authors study the effect of institutions on economic development.\nBusiness Case\nAs a business case, we are going to study a company that wants to find out whether subscribing to its newsletter has an effect on revenues. Since the travel agency cannot force customers to subscribing to the newsletter, it randomly sends reminder emails to infer the effect of the newsletter on revenues.\nSetting We assume that for a set of i.i.d. subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ we observed a tuple $(X_i, T_i, Y_i)$ comprised of\n a feature vector $X_i \\in \\mathbb R^n$ a treatment variable $T_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ a response $Y_i \\in \\mathbb R$  Crucially, we do not assume unconfoundedness / strong ignorability hence\n$$ \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\not \\perp \\ T_i \\ | \\ X_i $$\nInstrumental Variables The standard linear IV model is the following\n$$ Y_i = T_i \\alpha + X_i \\beta_1 + \\varepsilon_i \\newline T_i = Z_i \\gamma + X_i \\beta_2 + u_i $$\nWe assume there exists an instrumental variable $Z_i \\in \\mathbb R^k$ that satisfies the following assumptions.\n  Assumption 1: Exclusion: $\\mathbb E [Z \\varepsilon] = 0$\n  Assumption 2: Relevance: $\\mathbb E [Z T] \\neq 0$\n  The model can be represented by a DAG.\nfrom src.plots import dag_iv dag_iv()  The IV estimator is instead unbiased\n$$ \\hat \\beta_{IV} = (Z\u0026rsquo;X)^{-1}(Z\u0026rsquo;Y) $$\nPotential Outcomes Perspective We need to extend the potential outcomes framework in order to allow for the instrumental variable $Z$. First we define the potential outcomes as $Y^{(D(Z_i))}(Z_i)$\nThe assumptions become\n Exclusion: $Y^{(D(Z_i))}(Z_i) = Y^{(T(Z_i))}$ Relevance: $P(z) = \\mathbb E [T, Z=z]$  We assume that $Z$ is fully randomly assigned (while $T$ is not).\nWhat does IV estimate?\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb E[Y_i | Z_i = 1] - \\mathbb E[Y_i | Z_i = 0] \u0026amp;= \\Pr (D_i^{(1)} - D_i^{(0)} = 1) \\times \\mathbb E \\Big[ Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)} = 1 \\ \\Big | \\ D_i^{(1)} - D_i^{(0)} = 1 \\Big] - \\newline \u0026amp;- \\Pr (D_i^{(1)} - D_i^{(0)} = -1) \\times \\mathbb E \\Big[ Y_i^{(1)} - Y_i^{(0)} = 1 \\ \\Big | \\ D_i^{(1)} - D_i^{(0)} = -1 \\Big] \\end{aligned} $$\nIs this a quantity of interest? Almost. There are two issues.\nFirst, the first term is the treatment effect, but only for those individuals for whom $D_i^{(1)} - D_i^{(0)} = 1$, i.e. those that are induced into treatment by $Z_i$. These individuals are referred to as compliers.\nSecond, the second term is problematic since it removes from the first effect, the local effect of another subpopulation: $D_i^{(1)} - D_i^{(0)} = -1$, i.e. those that are induced out of treatment by $Z_i$. These individuals are referred to as defiers.\nWe can get rid of defiers with a simple assumption.\nAssumption 3: monotonocity: $D_i^{(1)} \\geq D_i^{(0)}$ (or viceversa)\n All effects must be monotone in the same direction Fundamentally untestable  Then, the IV estimator can be expressed as a ration between two differences in means\n$$ \\hat \\beta_{IV} = \\frac{\\mathbb E[Y_i | Z_i = 1] - \\mathbb E[Y_i | Z_i = 0]}{\\mathbb E[T_i | Z_i = 1] - \\mathbb E[T_i | Z_i = 0]} $$\nStructural Perspective One can interpret the IV estimator as a GMM estimator that uses the exclusion restriction as estimating equation.\n$$ \\hat \\beta_{GMM} = \\arg \\min_{\\beta} \\mathbb E \\Big[ Z (Y - \\alpha T - \\beta X) \\Big]^2 $$\nThe Algebra of IV TBD\nDemand and Supply TBD\nAcademic Application 1 As an research paper replication, we are going to replicate Does compulsory school attendance affect schooling and earnings? (1991) by Angrist and Krueger. The authors study the effect of education on wages.\nThe problem of studying the relationship of education on wages is that there might be factors that influence both education and wages but we do not observe, for example ability. Students that have higher ability might decide to stay longer in school and also get higher wages afterwards.\nThe idea of the authors is to use the quarter of birth as an instrument for education. In fact, quarter of birth is plausibly exogenous with respect to wages while, on the other hand, is correlated with education. Why? Students that are both in the last quarter of the year cannot drop out as early as other students and therefore are exposed to more eduction.\nWe can represent the DAG of their model as follows.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import *  dag_iv(Y=\u0026quot;wage\u0026quot;, T=\u0026quot;education\u0026quot;, Z=\u0026quot;quarter of birth\u0026quot;, U=\u0026quot;ability\u0026quot;)  A shortcoming of this instrument comes out of the fact that the population of compliers is students that drop out of school as soon as possible, we will know the treatment effect only for this population.

The problem is that there might exist other factors that affects both the quality of institutions and GDP. The authors suggest the following problems as sources of endogeneity:\n richer countries may be able to afford or prefer better institutions variables that affect income may also be correlated with institutional differences the construction of the index may be biased; analysts may be biased towards seeing countries with higher income having better institutions  The idea of the authors is to use settler\u0026rsquo;s mortality during the colonization period as an instrument for the quality of institutions. They hypothesize that higher mortality rates of colonizers led to the establishment of institutions that were more extractive in nature (less protection against expropriation), and these institutions still persist today.\nWe can represent their DAG as follows.\ndag_iv(Y=\u0026quot;GDP\u0026quot;, T=\u0026quot;institutions\u0026quot;, Z=\u0026quot;settlers' mortality\u0026quot;, U=\u0026quot;tons of stuff\u0026quot;)  First, let\u0026rsquo;s load the data (available here) and have a look at it.\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/ajr02.csv',index_col=0) df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  GDP Exprop Mort Latitude Neo Africa Asia Namer Samer logMort Latitude2     1 8.39 6.50 78.20 0.3111 0 1 0 0 0 4.359270 0.096783   2 7.77 5.36 280.00 0.1367 0 1 0 0 0 5.634790 0.018687   3 9.13 6.39 68.90 0.3778 0 0 0 0 1 4.232656 0.142733   4 9.90 9.32 8.55 0.3000 1 0 0 0 0 2.145931 0.090000   5 9.29 7.50 85.00 0.2683 0 0 0 1 0 4.442651 0.071985     The data contains the main variables, DGP, Exprop and Mort, plus some geographical information.\nOLS What would we get if we were to ignore the endogeneity problem?

In particular, the authors consider the following sets of variables:\n climat; proxied by latitude differences that affect both economic performance and institutions, eg. cultural, historical, etc.; controlled for with the use of continent dummies  reg2 = smf.ols('GDP ~ Exprop + Latitude + Latitude2', df).fit() reg3 = smf.ols('GDP ~ Exprop + Latitude + Latitude2 + Asia + Africa + Namer + Samer', df).fit()  from statsmodels.iolib.summary2 import summary_col summary_col(results=[reg1,reg2,reg3], float_format='%0.2f', stars = True, info_dict={'No. observations' : lambda x: f\u0026quot;{int(x.nobs):d}\u0026quot;}, regressor_order=['Intercept','Exprop','Latitude','Latitude2'])    GDP I GDP II GDP III   Intercept 4.66*** 4.55*** 5.95***    (0.41) (0.45) (0.68)   Exprop 0.52*** 0.49*** 0.40***    (0.06) (0.07) (0.06)   Latitude  2.16 0.42     (1.68) (1.47)   Latitude2  -2.12 0.44     (2.86) (2.48)   Africa   -1.06**      (0.41)   Asia   -0.74*      (0.42)   Namer   -0.17      (0.40)   Samer   -0.12      (0.42)   R-squared 0.54 0.56 0.71   R-squared Adj. 0.53 0.54 0.67   No. observations 64 64 64   The coefficient of Expropr decreases in magnitude but remains positive and significant after the addition of geographical control variables. This might suggest that the endogeneity problem is not very pronounced. However, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to say given the large number of factors that could affect both institutions and GDP.\nIV In order for Mort to be a valid instrument it needs to satisfy the two IV conditions:\n Exclusion: Mort must be correlated to GDP only through Exprop Relevance: Mort must be correlated with Exprop  The exclusion restriction condition is untestable, however, we may not be satisfied if settler mortality rates in the 17th to 19th centuries have a direct effect on current GDP (in addition to their indirect effect through institutions).\nFor example, settler mortality rates may be related to the current disease environment in a country, which could affect current economic performance.\nThe authors argue this is unlikely because:\n The majority of settler deaths were due to malaria and yellow fever and had a limited effect on local people. The disease burden on local people in Africa or India, for example, did not appear to be higher than average, supported by relatively high population densities in these areas before colonization.  The relevance condition is testable and we can check it by computing the partial correlation between Mort and Exprop.

For example, we can imagine that wealthier customers are generating more revenue but are also less likely to subscribe.\nWe can represent the model with a DAG.\ndag_iv(Y=\u0026quot;revenue\u0026quot;, T=\u0026quot;subscribe\u0026quot;, Z=\u0026quot;reminder\u0026quot;, U=\u0026quot;income\u0026quot;)  OLS By directly inspecting the data, it seems that subscribed members actually generate less revenue than normal customers.\nsns.barplot(x='subscribe', y='revenue', data=df);  A linear regression confirms the graphical intuition.\nsmf.ols('revenue ~ 1 + subscribe', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  1.7752  0.086  20.697  0.000  1.607  1.943   subscribe  -0.7441  0.140  -5.334  0.000  -1.018  -0.470   However, if indeed wealthier customers generate more revenue and are less likely to subscribe, we have a negative omitted variable bias and we can expect the true effect of the newsletter to be bigger than the OLS estimate.\nIV Let\u0026rsquo;s now exploit the random variation induced by the discount. In order for our instrument to be valid, we need it to be exogenous (untestable) and relevant.

In this tutorial we are going to see in detail what this definition means, how to implement permutation tests, and their pitfalls.\nExample 1: is a coin fair? Let\u0026rsquo;s start with an example: suppose you wanted to test whether a coin is fair. You throw the coin 10 times and you count the number of times you get heads. Let\u0026rsquo;s simulate the outcome.\nimport numpy as np np.random.seed(1) np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, 10)  array([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])  Out of 10 coin throws, we got only 2 heads. Does it mean that the coin is not fair?\nThe question that permutation testing is trying to answer is \u0026ldquo;how unlikely is the observed outcome under the null hypothesis that the coin is fair?\u0026rdquo;.\nIn this case we can directly compute this answer since we have a very little number of throws. The total number of outcomes is $2^{10}$. The number of as or more extreme outcomes, under the assumption that the coin is fair (50-50) is\n 0 heads: ${10 \\choose 0} = 1$ 1 head: ${10 \\choose 1} = 10$ 2 heads: ${10 \\choose 2} = 45$  So that the probability of getting the same or a more extreme outcome is\nfrom scipy.special import comb (comb(10, 0) + comb(10, 1) + comb(10, 2)) / 2**10  0.0546875  This probability seems low but not too low.\nHowever, we have forgot one thing. We want to test whether the coin is fair in either direction. We would suspect that the coin is unfair if we were getting few heads (as we did), but also if we were getting many heads. Therefore, we should account for both extremes.\nsum([comb(10, i) for i in [0, 1, 2, 8, 9, 10]]) / 2**10  0.109375  This number should not be surprising since it\u0026rsquo;s exactly double the previous one.\nIt is common in statistics to say that an event is unusual if its probability is less than 1 in 20, i.e. $5%$. If we were adopting that threshold, we would not conclude that getting 2 heads in 10 trows is so unusual. However, getting just one, would be.\nsum([comb(10, i) for i in [0, 1, 9, 10]]) / 2**10  0.021484375  Hypothesis Testing The process we just went through is called hypothesis testing. The components of an hypothesis test are:\n  A null hypothesis $H_0$\n in our case, that the coin war fair    A test statistic $t$\n in our case, the number of zeros    A level of significance $\\alpha$\n it is common to choose 5%    The idea behind permutation testing is the following: in a setting in which we are checking whether one variable has an effect on another variable, the two variables should not be correlated, under the null hypothesis . Therefore, we could re-shuffle the treatment variable and re-compute the test statistic. Lastly, we can compute the p-value as the fraction of as or more extremes outcomes under re-shuffling of the data.\nExample 2: are women smarter? Suppose now we were interested in knowing whether females perform better in a test than men. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by writing the data generating process under the assumption of no difference in scores. However, only 30% of the sample will be female.\nimport pandas as pd # Data generating process def generate_data_gender(N=100, seed=1): np.random.seed(seed) # Set seed for replicability data = pd.DataFrame({\u0026quot;female\u0026quot;: np.random.binomial(1, 0.3, N), \u0026quot;test_score\u0026quot;: np.random.exponential(3, N)}) return data  Let\u0026rsquo;s now generate a sample of size 100.\n# Generate data data_gender = generate_data_gender() data_gender.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  female test_score     0 0 1.186447   1 1 2.246348   2 0 6.513147   3 0 1.326091   4 0 7.175402     We can compute the treatment effect by computing the difference in mean outcomes between male and females.\ndef compute_score_diff(data): T = np.mean(data.loc[data['female']==1, 'test_score']) - np.mean(data.loc[data['female']==0, 'test_score']) return T  T = compute_score_diff(data_gender) print(f\u0026quot;The estimated treatment effect is {T}\u0026quot;)  The estimated treatment effect is -1.3612262580563321  It looks that females actually did worse than males. But is the difference statistically significant? We can perform a randomization test and compute the probability of observing a more extreme outcome.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s write the permutation routine that takes a variable in the data and permutes it.\ndef permute(data, var, r): temp_data = data.copy() temp_data[var] = np.random.choice(data[var], size=len(data), replace=r) return temp_data  We can now write the permutation test. It spits out a vector of statistics and prints the implied p-value.\ndef permutation_test(data, permute, var, compute_stat, K=1000, r=False): T = compute_stat(data) T_perm = [] for k in range(K): temp_data = permute(data, var, r) T_perm += [compute_stat(temp_data)] print(f\u0026quot;The p-value is {sum(np.abs(T_perm) \u0026gt;= np.abs(T))/K}\u0026quot;) return T_perm  Ts = permutation_test(data_gender, permute, 'test_score', compute_score_diff)  The p-value is 0.063  Apparently the result we have observed was quite unusual, but not at the 5% level. We can plot the distribution of statistics to visualize this result.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina' from src.utils import *  def plot_test(T, Ts, title): plt.hist(Ts, density=True, bins=30, alpha=0.7, color='C0') plt.vlines([-T, T], ymin=plt.ylim()[0], ymax=plt.ylim()[1], color='C2') plt.title(title);  plot_test(T, Ts, 'Distribution of score differences under permutation')  As we can see, the observed difference in scores is quite extreme with respect the distribution generate by the permutation.\nOne issue with the permutation test we just ran is that it is computationally expensive to draw without replacement. The standard and much faster procedure is to draw without replacement.\nTs_repl = permutation_test(data_gender, permute, 'test_score', compute_score_diff, r=True)  The p-value is 0.052  The p-value is virtually the same.\nHow accurate is the test? Since we have access to the data generating process, we can compute the true p-value via simulation. We draw many samples from the true data generating process and, for each, compute the difference in scores. The simulated p-value is going to be the frequency of more extreme statistics.\n# Function to simulate data and compute pvalue def simulate_stat(dgp, compute_stat, K=1000): T = compute_stat(dgp()) T_sim = [] for k in range(K): data = dgp(seed=k) T_sim += [compute_stat(data)] print(f\u0026quot;The p-value is {sum(np.abs(T_sim) \u0026gt;= np.abs(T))/K}\u0026quot;) return np.array(T_sim)  T_sim = simulate_stat(generate_data_gender, compute_score_diff)  The p-value is 0.038  Again, we can plot the distribution of simulated statistics to understand the computed p-value.\nplot_test(T, T_sim, 'Distribution of score differences under simulation')  As expected, most of the mass lies within the interval, indicating a relatively extreme result. We have just been \u0026ldquo;unlucky\u0026rdquo; with the draw, but the permutation test was accurate.\nPermutation tests vs t-tests What is the difference between a t-test and a permutation test?\nPermutation test advantages:\n does not make distributional assumptions not sensible to outliers can be computed also for statistics whose distribution is not known  Permutation test disadvantages:\n computationally intense very sample-dependent  Example 3: is university worth? Let\u0026rsquo;s now switch to a new example to compare t-tests and permutation tests.\nAssume we want to check whether university is a worthy investment. We have information about whether individuals attended university and their future salary. The problem here is that income is a particularly skewed variable.\n# Data generating process def generate_data_income(N=1000, seed=1): np.random.seed(seed) # Set seed for replicability university = np.random.binomial(1, 0.5, N) # Treatment data = pd.DataFrame({\u0026quot;university\u0026quot;: university, \u0026quot;income\u0026quot;: np.random.lognormal(university, 2.3, N)}) return data  data_income = generate_data_income() data_income.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  university income     0 0 5.305618   1 1 1.289598   2 0 6.507720   3 0 6.019961   4 0 0.034482     The distribution of income is very heavy tailed. Let\u0026rsquo;s plot its density across the two groups.\nsns.kdeplot(data=data_income, x=\u0026quot;income\u0026quot;, hue=\u0026quot;university\u0026quot;)\\ .set(title='Income density by group');  The distribution is so skewed that we cannot actually visually perceive differences between the two groups. Let\u0026rsquo;s compute the expected difference.\ndef compute_income_diff(data): T = np.mean(data.loc[data['university']==1, 'income']) - np.mean(data.loc[data['university']==0, 'income']) return T  T = compute_income_diff(data_income) T  23.546974435985444  It looks like university graduates have higher income. Is this difference statistically different from zero? Let\u0026rsquo;s perform a permutation test.\nT_perm = permutation_test(data_income, permute, 'university', compute_income_diff)  The p-value is 0.011  The permutation test is telling us that the difference is extremely unusual under the null hypothesis. In other words, it is very unlikely that university graduates earn the same income of non-university graduates.\nWhat would be the outcome of a standard t-test?\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind ttest_ind(data_income.query('university==1')['income'], data_income.query('university==0')['income'])  Ttest_indResult(statistic=1.5589492598056494, pvalue=0.1193254252009701)  As we can see, the two tests provide extremely different results. The t-test is much more conservative, telling us that the unlikeliness of the data is just $12%$ compared to the $1.1%$ of the permutation test.\nThe reason is that we have extremely skewed data. The t-test is very sensible to extreme observation and will therefore compute a very high variance because of very few data points.\nThe permutation test can further address the problem of a skewed outcome distribution by using a test statistic that is more sensible to outliers. Let\u0026rsquo;s perform the permutation test using the trimmed mean instead of the mean.\nfrom scipy.stats import trim_mean def compute_income_mediandiff(data): T = np.median(data.loc[data['university']==1, 'income']) - np.median(data.loc[data['university']==0, 'income']) return T  T_perm = permutation_test(data_income, permute, 'university', compute_income_mediandiff)  The p-value is 0.0  In this case, the permutation test is extremely confident that the trimmed mean of the two groups is different.\nHowever, an advantage of the t-test is speed. Let\u0026rsquo;s compare the two tests by computing their execution time. Note that this is just a rough approximation since the permutation test could be sensible optimized.\nimport time # No replacement start = time.time() permutation_test(data_income, permute, 'university', compute_income_diff) print(f\u0026quot;Elapsed time without replacement: {time.time() - start}\u0026quot;) # Replacement start = time.time() ttest_ind(data_income.query('university==1')['income'], data_income.query('university==0')['income']) print(f\u0026quot;Elapsed time with replacement: {time.time() - start}\u0026quot;)  The p-value is 0.016 Elapsed time without replacement: 0.28911614418029785 Elapsed time with replacement: 0.00125885009765625  The permutation test is 300 times slower. This can be a particularly relevant difference for larger sample sizes.\nConclusion In this tutorial, we have seen how to perform permutation tests across different data generating processes.\nThe underlying principle is the same: permute an variable that is assumed to be random under the null hypothesis and re-compute the test statistic. Then check how unusual was the test statistic in the original dataset.\n","date":1649980800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649980800,"objectID":"a5a6a7d39cdee5c66211055b0347a2c5","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/post/permutation_test/","publishdate":"2022-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/permutation_test/","section":"post","summary":"If you search \u0026ldquo;permutation test\u0026rdquo; on Wikipedia, you get the following definition:\n A permutation test (also called re-randomization test) is an exact statistical hypothesis test making use of the proof by contradiction in which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis is obtained by calculating all possible values of the test statistic under possible rearrangements of the observed data.","tags":null,"title":"Permutation Tests for Dummies","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this tutorial, we are going to see how to design the most welfare-improving policy in presence of treatment effect heterogeneity and treatment costs or budget constraints.\nRequisites\nFor this tutorial, I assume you are familiar with the following concepts:\n Rubin\u0026rsquo;s potential outcome framework Propensity weighting or uplifting AIPW or Double Robust Estimators Causal Trees  Academic Replication\nWe are going to replicate the paper by Hanna and Olken (2018) in which the authors study the optimal allocation of a cash transfer to households in Peru. We slightly twist the original paper by actually assigning the transfer and assuming 100% consumption.\nBusiness Case\nWe are going to study a company that has to decide which consumers to target with ads.\nSetting We assume that for a set of i.i.d. subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ we observed a tuple $(X_i, T_i, Y_i)$ comprised of\n a feature vector $X_i \\in \\mathbb R^n$ a treatment variable $T_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ a response $Y_i \\in \\mathbb R$  Assumption 1 : unconfoundedness (or ignorability, or selection on observables)\n$$ \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\perp \\ T_i \\ | \\ X_i $$\ni.e. conditional on observable characteristics $X$, the treatment assignment $T$ is as good as random.\nAssumption 2: overlap (or bounded support)\n$$ \\exists \\eta \u0026gt; 0 \\ : \\ \\eta \\leq \\mathbb E \\left[ T_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right] \\leq 1-\\eta $$\ni.e. no observation is deterministically assigned to the treatment or control group.\nPolicy Learning The objective of policy learning is to decide which people to treat. More explicitly, we want to learn a map from observable characteristics to a (usually binary) policy space.\n$$ \\pi : \\mathcal X \\to \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace $$\nPolicy learning is closely related to the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects. In fact, in both settings, we want to investigate how the treatment affects different individuals in different ways.\nThe main difference between policy learning and the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is the objective function. In policy learning, we are acting in a limited resources setting where providing treatment is costly and the cost could depend on individual characteristics. For example, it might be more costly to vaccinate individuals that live in remote areas. Therefore, one might not just want to treat individuals with the largest expected treatment effect, but the ones for whom treatment is most cost-effective.\nThe utilitarian value of a policy $\\pi$\n$$ V(\\pi) = \\mathbb E \\Big[ Y_i(\\pi(X_i)) \\Big] = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y^{(0)}_i \\big] + \\mathbb E \\big[ \\tau(X_i) \\pi(X_i) \\big] $$\nmeasures the expectation of the potential outcome $Y$ if we were to assign treatment $T$ according to policy $\\pi$. This expectation can be split into two parts:\n The baseline expected potential outcome $\\mathbb E \\big[ Y^{(0)}_i \\big]$ The expected effect of the policy $\\mathbb E \\big[ \\tau(X_i) \\pi(X_i) \\big]$  The objective of policy learning is to learn a policy with high value $V(\\pi)$. As part (2) of the formula makes clear, you get a higher value if you treat the people with a high treatment effect $\\tau(x)$.\nA simple approach could be to assign treatment according to a thresholding rule $\\tau(x) \u0026gt; c$, where $c$ is some cost below which is not worth treating individuals (or there is not enough budget).\nHowever, estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function $\\tau(x)$ and learning a good policy $\\pi(x)$ are different problems.\n the correct loss function for policy learning is not the mean squared error (MSE) on $\\tau(x)$  we want to maximize welfare!   the CATE function $\\tau(x)$ might not use some features for targeting  e.g. cannot discriminate based on race or gender   you don\u0026rsquo;t want to have feature that people can influence  e.g. use a self-reported measure that people can distort    We would like to find a loss function $L(\\pi ; Y_i, X_i, T_i)$ such that\n$$ \\mathbb E \\big[ L(\\pi ; Y_i, X_i, T_i) \\big] = - V(\\pi) $$\nIPW Loss Kitagawa and Tenenov (2018) propose to learn an empirical estimate of the value function using inverse propensity weighting (IPW).\n$$ \\hat \\pi = \\arg \\max_{\\pi} \\Big\\lbrace \\hat V(\\pi) : \\pi \\in \\Pi \\Big\\rbrace $$\nwhere\n$$ \\hat V(\\pi) = \\frac{ \\mathbb I \\big(\\lbrace T_i = \\pi(X_i) \\rbrace \\big) }{ \\mathbb P \\big[ \\lbrace T_i = \\pi(X_i) \\rbrace \\ \\big| \\ X_i \\big] } Y_i $$\nThe authors show that under unconfoundedness, if the propensity score $e(x)$ is known and $\\Pi$ is not too complex, the value of the estimated policy converges to the optimal value.\nNote that this is a very different problem from the normal optimization problem with a MSE loss. In fact, we now have a binary argument in the loss function which makes the problem similar to a classification problem, in which we want to classify people into high gain and low gain categories.\nAIPW Loss If propensity score $e(x)$ is not known, we can use a doubly robust estimator, exactly as for the average treatment effect.\n$$ \\hat V = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\begin{cases} \\hat \\Gamma_i \\quad \u0026amp;\\text{if} \\quad \\pi(X_i) = 1 \\newline\n \\hat \\Gamma_i \\quad \u0026amp;\\text{if} \\quad \\pi(X_i) = 0 \\end{cases} $$  where\n$$ \\hat \\Gamma_i = \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) + \\frac{T_i }{\\hat e(X_i)} \\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(1)}(X_i) \\right) - \\frac{(1-T_i) }{1-\\hat e(X_i)} \\left( Y_i - \\hat \\mu^{(0)}(X_i) \\right) $$\nThe relationship with AIPW is that $\\hat \\tau_{AIPW} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\hat \\Gamma_i$. Therefore, the objective function $V(\\pi)$ is build so that when we assign treatment to a unit we \u0026ldquo;gain\u0026rdquo; the double-robust score $\\hat \\tau_{AIPW}$, while, if we do not assign treatment, we \u0026ldquo;pay\u0026rdquo; the double-robust score $\\hat \\tau_{AIPW}$.\nAcademic Application For the academic applicaiton, we are going to replicate the paper by Hanna and Olken (2018) in which the authors study the optimal allocation of a cash transfer to households in Peru.

We can compare the estimated policy with the oracle policy that assign treatment to each cost-effective unit.\nT_oracle = (df_oracle['welfare_1'] - df_oracle['welfare_0']) \u0026gt; cost V_oracle = (df_oracle['welfare_1'] - cost - df_oracle['welfare_0'] ) * T_oracle print(f'Oracle policy value (N_T={sum(T_oracle)}): {np.mean(V_oracle) :.4}')  Oracle policy value (N_T=17630): 0.07494  We actually achieved 79% of the potential policy gains! Also note that our policy is too generous, treating more units than optimal. But how well would we have done if the same amount of cash transfers were given at random?\nT_rand = np.random.binomial(1, sum(T_hat)/len(df), len(df)) V_rand = (df_oracle['welfare_1'] - cost - df_oracle['welfare_0'] ) * T_rand print(f'Random policy value (N_T={sum(T_rand)}): {np.mean(V_rand) :.4}')  Random policy value (N_T=21359): 0.0002698  A random assignment of the same amount of cash transfers would not achieve any effect. However, this assumes that we already know the optimal amount of funds to distribute. What if instead we had treated everyone?\nV_all = (df_oracle['welfare_1'] - cost - df_oracle['welfare_0'] ) print(f'All-treated policy value (N_T={len(df)}): {np.mean(V_all) :.4}')  All-treated policy value (N_T=45378): 0.0004019  Indiscriminate treatment would again not achieve any effect. Lastly, what if we had just estimated the treatment effect using AIPW and used it as a threshold?\nfrom econml.dr import LinearDRLearner model = LinearDRLearner(random_state=1).fit(Y=df[dgp.Y], T=df[dgp.T], X=df[dgp.X]) T_ipw = model.effect(X=df[dgp.X], T0=0, T1=1) \u0026gt; cost V_ipw = (df_oracle['welfare_1'] - cost - df_oracle['welfare_0'] ) * T_ipw print(f'IPW policy value (N_T={sum(T_ipw)}): {np.mean(V_ipw) :.4}')  IPW policy value (N_T=21003): 0.06293  We are actually doing better! Weird\u0026hellip;\nBusiness Case We are given the following problem:\n A firm would like to understand which customers to show an ad, in order to increase revenue. The firm ran a A/B test showing a random sample of customers an ad. First, try to understand if there is heterogeneity in treatment. Then, decide which customers to show the ad, given that ads are costly (1$ each). Further suppose that you cannot discriminate on gender. How do the results change?\n We start by drawing a sample from the data generating process.\nfrom src.utils import * from src.dgp import dgp_ad  dgp = dgp_ad() df = dgp.generate_data() df.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  male black age educ ad revenue     0 0 0 55.0 1 False -0.327221   1 1 1 47.0 2 False 0.659393   2 0 1 31.0 2 True 2.805178   3 0 1 51.0 2 False -0.508548   4 0 0 48.0 0 True 0.762280     We have information on the number of pages visited in the previous month, whether the user is located in the US, whether it connects by mobile and the revenue pre-intervention.\nWe are going to use the econml library to estimate the treatment effects. First, we use the DRLearner library to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a double robust estimator. We can specify both the model_propensity for $e(x)$ and the model_regression for $\\mu(x)$.\nfrom econml.dr import DRLearner model = DRLearner(random_state=1).fit(Y=df[dgp.Y], T=df[dgp.T], X=df[dgp.X]);  We can plot a visual representation of the treatment effect heterogeneity using the SingleTreePolicyInterpreter function, which infers a tree representation of the treatment effects learned from another model.\nfrom econml.cate_interpreter import SingleTreeCateInterpreter SingleTreeCateInterpreter(max_depth=2, random_state=1).interpret(model, X=df[dgp.X]).plot(feature_names=dgp.X)  It seems that the most relevant dimension of treatment heterogeneity is education.\nWe can now use policy learning to estimate a treatment policy. We use the DRPolicyTree from the econml package.\nfrom econml.policy import DRPolicyTree policy = DRPolicyTree(random_state=1, max_depth=2).fit(Y=df[dgp.Y], T=df[dgp.T], X=df[dgp.X]) policy.plot(feature_names=dgp.X)  We will now assume that the treatment is costly.\ncost = 1 policy = DRPolicyTree(random_state=1, max_depth=2).fit(Y=df[dgp.Y]-cost*df[dgp.T], T=df[dgp.T], X=df[dgp.X]) policy.plot(feature_names=dgp.X)  As we can see, the model decides to use race to discriminate treatment. However, let\u0026rsquo;s now suppose we cannot discriminate on race and gender.\nX_short = ['age', 'educ'] policy = DRPolicyTree(random_state=1, max_depth=2).fit(Y=df[dgp.Y]-cost*df[dgp.T], T=df[dgp.T], X=df[X_short]) policy.plot(feature_names=X_short)  In this case, the model uses education instead of race in order to assign treatment.\nReferences  Who Should Be Treated?

This might happen either when an experiment is stratified or in observational studies.\nRequisites\nFor this tutorial, I assume you are familiar with the following concepts:\n Rubin\u0026rsquo;s potential outcome framework Ordinary least squares regression  Academic Application\nAs an academic application, we are going to replicate Evaluating the Econometric Evaluations of Training Programs with Experimental Data (1986) by Lalonde and the followup paper Causal Effects in Non-Experimental Studies: Reevaluating the Evaluation of Training Programs (1999) by Dahejia and Wahba. These papers study a randomized intervention providing work experienced to improve labor market outcomes.\nBusiness Case\nTBD\nSetting We assume that for a set of i.i.d. subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ we observed a tuple $(X_i, D_i, Y_i)$ comprised of\n a feature vector $X_i \\in \\mathbb R^n$ a treatment assignment $D_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ a response $Y_i \\in \\mathbb R$  Assumption 1 : unconfoundedness (or ignorability, or selection on observables, or conditional independence)\n$$ \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ X_i $$\ni.e. conditional on observable characteristics $X$, the treatment assignment $T$ is as good as random. What this assumption rules out is selection on unobservables. Moreover, it\u0026rsquo;s untestable.\nAssumption 2: overlap (or common support)\n$$ \\exists \\eta \u0026gt; 0 \\ : \\ \\eta \\leq \\mathbb E \\left[ D_i = 1 \\ \\big | \\ X_i = x \\right] \\leq 1-\\eta $$\ni.e. no observation is deterministically assigned to the treatment or control group. We need this assumption for counterfactual statements to make sense. If some observations had zero probability of (not) being treated, it would make no sense to try to estimate their counterfactual outcome in case they would have (not) being treated. Also this assumption is untestable.\nAssumption 3: stable unit treatment value (SUTVA)\n$$ Y_i^{(D_i)} \\perp D_j \\quad \\forall j \\neq i $$\ni.e. the potential outcome of one individual is independent from the treatment status of any other individual. Common violations of this assumption include\n general equilibrium effects spillover effects  This assumption is untestable.\nPropensity Scores Exogenous Treatment The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we do not observe counterfactual outcomes, i.e. we do not observe what would have happened to treated units if they had not received the treatment and viceversa.\nIf treatment is exogenous, we know that the difference in means identifies the average treatment effect $\\mathbb E[\\tau]$.\n$$ \\mathbb E[\\tau] = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_i \\ \\big| \\ D_i = 1 \\big] - \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_i \\ \\big| \\ D_i = 0 \\big] = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_{i}^{(1)} - Y_{i}^{(0)} \\big] $$\nTherefore, we can build an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect as the empirical counterpart of the expression above\n$$ \\hat \\tau(Y, D) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\big( D_i Y_i - (1-D_i) Y_i \\big) $$\nIn case treatment is not randomly assigned, we use the Thompson Horowitz (1952) estimator\n$$ \\hat \\tau(Y, D) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{D_i Y_i}{\\pi_{i}} - \\frac{(1-D_i) Y_i}{1 - \\pi_{i}} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\pi_{i} = \\Pr(D_i=1)$ is the probability of being treated, also known as propensity score. Sometimes the propensity score is known, for example when treatment is stratified. However, in general, it is not.\nConditionally Exogenous Treatment In many cases and especially in observational studies, treatment $D$ is not unconditionally exogenous, but it\u0026rsquo;s exogenous only after we condition on some characteristic $X$. If these characteristics are observables, we have the unconfoundedness assumption.\nUnder unconfoundedness, we can still identify the average treatment effect, as a conditional difference in means:\n$$ \\mathbb E[\\tau] = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_{i}^{(1)} - Y_{i}^{(0)} \\ \\big| \\ X_i \\big] $$\nThe main problem is that we need to condition of the observables that actually make the unconfoundedness assumption hold. This might be tricky in two cases:\n when we have many observables when we do not know the functional form of the observables that we need to condition on  The main contribution of Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) is to show that if unconfoundedness holds, then\n$$ \\big \\lbrace Y_i^{(1)} , Y_i^{(0)} \\big \\rbrace \\ \\perp \\ D_i \\ | \\ \\pi(X_i) $$\ni.e. you only need to condition on $\\pi(X)$ in order to recover the average treatment effect.\n$$ \\mathbb E[\\tau] = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_{i}^{(1)} - Y_{i}^{(0)} \\ \\big| \\ \\pi(X_i) \\big] $$\nThis implies the following inverse propensity-weighted estimator:\n$$ \\hat \\tau^{IPW} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{D_i Y_i}{\\hat \\pi(X_i)} - \\frac{(1-D_i) Y_i}{1 - \\hat \\pi(X_i)} \\right) $$\nwhich, under unconfoundedness is an unbiased estimator of the average treatment effect, $\\mathbb E \\left[\\hat \\tau^{IPW} \\right] = \\tau$.\nThis is a very practically relevant result since it tells us that we need to condition on a single variable instead of a potentially infinite dimensional array. The only thing we need to do is to estimate $\\pi(X_i)$.\nComments Actual vs Estimated Scores\nHirano and Ridder (2002) show that even when you know the true propensity score $\\pi(X)$, it\u0026rsquo;s better to plug in the estimated propensity score $\\hat \\pi(X)$. Why? The idea is that the deviation between the actual and the estimated propensity score is providing some additional information. Therefore, it is best to use the actual fraction of treated rather than the theoretical one.\nPropensity Scores and Regression\nWhat is the difference between running a regression with controls vs doing propensity score matching?\nAranow and Miller (2015) investigate this comparison in depth. First of all, whenever you are inserting control variables in a regression, you are implicitly thinking about propensity scores. Both approaches are implicitly estimating counterfactual outcomes. Usually OLS extrapolates further away from the actual support than propensity score does.\nIn the tweet (and its comments) below you can find further discussion and comments.\nThank you for tolerating such a vague poll question. Let me explain why I think this is a useful thing to bring front and certain, and highlight what I think is a flaw in how much of econometrics is taught, currently. 1/n pic.twitter.com/Wm2jFereYO\n\u0026mdash; Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham (@paulgp) December 14, 2021  Academic Application As an academic application, we are going to replicate Causal Effects in Non-Experimental Studies: Reevaluating the Evaluation of Training Programs (1999) by Dahejia and Wahba.\nThis study builds on a previous study: Evaluating the Econometric Evaluations of Training Programs with Experimental Data (1986) by Lalonde. In this study, the author compares observational and experimental methods. In particular, he studies an experimental intervention called the NSW (National Supported Work demonstration). The NSW is a temporary training program to give work experience to unemployed people.\nThe exogenous variation allows us to estimate the treatment effect as a difference in means. The author then asks: what if we didn\u0026rsquo;t have access to an experiment? In particular, what if we did not have information on the control group? He takes a sample of untreated people from the PSID panel and use them as a control group.\nExperimental Data Let\u0026rsquo;s start by loading the NSW data.\n%matplotlib inline %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  from src.utils import *  df_nsw = pd.read_csv('data/l86_nsw.csv') df_nsw.head()   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }  \n  treat age educ black hisp marr nodegree re74 re75 re78     0 1 37 11 1 0 1 1 0.0 0.0 9930.045898   1 1 22 9 0 1 0 1 0.0 0.0 3595.894043   2 1 30 12 1 0 0 0 0.0 0.0 24909.449219   3 1 27 11 1 0 0 1 0.0 0.0 7506.145996   4 1 33 8 1 0 0 1 0.0 0.0 289.789886     The treatment variable is treat and the outcome of interest is re78, the income in 1978.

This makes sense since the people selected for the NSW program are people that are younger, less experienced and unemployed.\nLalonde (1986) argues in favor of experimental approaches by showing that using a non-experimental setting, one would not be able to estimate the true treatment effect. Actually, one could even get statistically significant results of the opposite sign.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s repeat the regression exercise for the PSID data.\nsmf.ols('re78 ~ treat', df_psid).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  9995.9500  623.715  16.026  0.000  8770.089  1.12e+04   treat -3646.8065  959.704  -3.800  0.000 -5533.027 -1760.586   The estimated coefficient is negative and significant.

In particular, the argue in favor of controlling for pre-intervention income, re74 and re75.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s just linearly insert the control variables in the regression.\nsmf.ols('re78 ~ treat + ' + ' + '.join(X), df_psid).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept -1089.9263  2913.224  -0.374  0.708 -6815.894  4636.042   treat  2642.1456  1039.655  2.541  0.011  598.694  4685.597   educ  521.5869  208.751  2.499  0.013  111.284  931.890   black -1026.6762  1006.433  -1.020  0.308 -3004.830  951.478   hisp  -903.1023  1726.419  -0.523  0.601 -4296.394  2490.189   marr  1026.6143  943.788  1.088  0.277  -828.410  2881.639   nodegree -1469.3712  1166.114  -1.260  0.208 -3761.379  822.637   re74  0.1928  0.058  3.329  0.001  0.079  0.307   re75  0.4976  0.070  7.068  0.000  0.359  0.636   The treatment effect is now positive, borderline significant, and close to the experimental estimate of $1794$$. Moreover, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell whether this is the correct functional form for the control variables.\nInverse propensity score weighting Another option is to use inverse propensity score weighting. First, we need to estimate the treatment probability. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a very simple standard model to predict binary outcomes.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegressionCV pi = LogisticRegressionCV().fit(y=df_psid[T], X=df_psid[X]) df_psid['pscore'] = pi.predict_proba(df_psid[X])[:,1]  How does the distribution of the propensity scores look like?\nsns.histplot(data=df_psid, x='pscore', hue=T, bins=20)\\ .set(title='Distribution of propensity scores, PSID data', xlabel='');  It seems that indeed we predict higher propensity scores for treated people, and viceversa, indicating a strong selection on observable. However, there is also a considerable amount of overlap.\nWe can now estimate the treatment effect by weighting by the inverse of the propensity score. First, let\u0026rsquo;s exclude observations with a very extreme predicted score.\ndf_psid1 = df_psid[(df_psid['pscore']\u0026lt;0.9) \u0026amp; (df_psid['pscore']\u0026gt;0.1)]  Now we can need to construct the weights.\ndf_psid1['weight'] = df_psid1['treat'] / df_psid1['pscore'] + (1-df_psid1['treat']) / (1-df_psid1['pscore'])  Finally, we run a weighted regression of income on the treatment program.\nest = smf.wls('re78 ~ treat', df_psid1, weights=df_psid1['weight']).fit() est.summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  4038.1507  512.268  7.883  0.000  3030.227  5046.074   treat  2166.8750  730.660  2.966  0.003  729.250  3604.500   The effect is positive, statistically significant and very close to the experimental estimate of $1794$$.\nWhat would have been the propensity scores if we had used the NSW experimental sample? If it\u0026rsquo;s a well done experiment with a sufficiently large sample, we would expect the propensity scores to concentrate around the percentage of people treated, $0.41$ in our data.\npi = LogisticRegressionCV().fit(y=df_nsw[T], X=df_nsw[X]) df_nsw['pscore'] = pi.predict_proba(df_nsw[X])[:,1]  sns.histplot(data=df_nsw, x='pscore', hue=T, bins=20)\\ .set(title='Distribution of propensity scores, NSW data', xlabel='');  Indeed, now the distribution of the p-scores is concentrated around the treatment frequency in the data.

In this case, we can get a local estimate of the treatment effect by comparing units just above and just below the threshold by assuming that there is no sorting/gaming around it.\nRequisites\nFor this tutorial, I assume you are familiar with the following concepts:\n Rubin\u0026rsquo;s potential outcome framework Ordinary least squares regression Non-parametric regression Instrumental variables  Academic Application\nAs an academic application, we are going to replicate Do voters affect or elect policies? Evidence from the US House (2004) by Lee, Moretti, Butler. The authors study whether electoral strength has an effect on policies. To identify the effect, they the advantage that is given by incumbency status, and the quasi-exogeneity given by close elections.\nBusiness Case\nTBD\nSetting We assume that for a set of i.i.d. subjects $i = 1, \u0026hellip;, n$ we observed a tuple $(X_i, D_i, Y_i, Z_i)$ comprised of\n a feature vector $X_i \\in \\mathbb R^n$ a treatment assignment $D_i \\in \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$ a response $Y_i \\in \\mathbb R$  outcome of interest that depends on both $X_i$ and $D_i$   a forcing variable $Z_i \\in \\mathbb R$  variable that determines treatment assignment $D_i$    We normalize the forcing variable $Z_i$ such that $Z_i=0$ corresponds to the cutoff for treatment assignment. We will distinguish two cases for the effect of $Z_i$ on $D_i$:\n  Sharp RD: $D_i = (Z_i \\geq 0)$\n treatment is exactly determined by the cutoff    Fuzzy RD: $\\lim_{z \\to 0_{-}} \\mathbb E[D_i | Z_i=z] \\neq \\lim_{z \\to 0_{+}} \\mathbb E[D_i | Z_i=z]$\n treatment probability changes at the cutoff    Assumption 1 : CE smoothness\nAssumption 2: no sorting\nRegression Discontinuity The key behind regression discontinuity is what is called a forcing variable that determines treatment assignment. Common examples include test scores for university enrollment (you need a certain test score to get access university) or income for some policy eligibility (you need to be below a certain income threshold to be eligible for a subsidy).\nClearly, in this setting, treatment is not exogenous. However, the idea behind regression discontinuity is that units sufficiently close to the discontinuity $Z_i=0$ are sufficiently similar so that we can attribute differences in the outcome $Y_i$ to the treatment $T_i$.\nWhat does sufficiently exactly mean?\nIn practice, we are assuming a certain degree of smoothness of the conditional expectation function $\\mathbb E[D_i | Z_i=z]$. If this assumption holds, we can estimate the local average treatment effect\n$$ \\tau^{LATE} = \\lim_{z \\to 0_{+}} \\mathbb E[Y_i | Z_i=z] - \\lim_{z \\to 0_{-}} \\mathbb E[Y_i | Z_i=z] = \\mathbb E \\big[ Y_{i}^{(1)} - Y_{i}^{(0)} | Z_i=0 \\big] $$\nNote that this is the average treatment effect for a very narrow set of individuals: those that are extremely close to the cutoff.\nData Challenge Regression discontinuity design is a particularly data hungry procedure. In fact, we need to\n have a very good flexible approximation of the conditional expectation of the outcome $Y_i$ at the cutoff $Z_i=0$ while also accounting for the effect of the forcing variable $Z$ on the outcome $Y$  If we knew the functional form of $\\mathbb E[Y_i | Z_i]$, it would be easy.\nMcCrary Test Regression Kink Design Academic Application As an academic application, we are going to replicate Do voters affect or elect policies?

However we can already see some discontinuity at the threshold: it seems that incumbents do not get vote shares below 0.35.\nTo have a more transparent representation of the data, we can use a binscatterplot. Binscatterplots are very similar to histograms with a main difference: instead of having a fixed width, they have a fixed number of observations per bin.\nfrom scipy.stats import binned_statistic def binscatter(x, y, bins=30, area=True, **kwargs): y_bins, x_edges, _ = binned_statistic(x, y, statistic='mean', bins=bins) x_bins = (x_edges[:-1] + x_edges[1:]) / 2 p = sns.scatterplot(x_bins, y_bins, **kwargs) if area: y_std, _, _ = binned_statistic(x, y, statistic='std', bins=bins) plt.fill_between(x_bins, y_bins-y_std, y_bins+y_std, alpha=0.2, color='C0') return p  We can now plot the average vote share by previous vote share. The shades represent one standard deviation, at the bin level.\nbinscatter(df['lagdemvoteshare'], df['demvoteshare'], bins=100)\\ .set(title='Vote share and incumbency status', xlabel='Dem Vote Share (t-1)', ylabel='Dem Vote Share (t)'); plt.axvline(x=0.5, ls=\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;, color='C2'); plt.title('Vote share and incumbency status');  Now it seems quite clear that there exist a discontinuity at $0.5$. We can get a first estimate of the local average treatment effect by assuming a linear model and running a linear regression.\nsmf.ols('demvoteshare ~ lagdemvoteshare + (lagdemvoteshare\u0026gt;0.5)', df).fit().summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  0.2173  0.005  46.829  0.000  0.208  0.226   lagdemvoteshare  0.5[T.True]  0.0956  0.003  33.131  0.000  0.090  0.101   lagdemvoteshare  0.4865  0.011  42.539  0.000  0.464  0.509   The effect is positive and statistically significant. We can also allow the slope of the line to differ on the two sides of the discontinuity.\ndf = df.sort_values('lagdemvoteshare') model = smf.ols('demvoteshare ~ lagdemvoteshare * (lagdemvoteshare\u0026gt;0.5)', df).fit() model.summary().tables[1]    coef std err t P|t| [0.025 0.975]   Intercept  0.2256  0.007  34.588  0.000  0.213  0.238   lagdemvoteshare  0.5[T.True]  0.0747  0.012  6.334  0.000  0.052  0.098   lagdemvoteshare  0.4653  0.016  28.547  0.000  0.433  0.497   lagdemvoteshare:lagdemvoteshare  0.5[T.True]  0.0418  0.023  1.827  0.068  -0.003  0.087   Let\u0026rsquo;s plot the predicted vote share over the previous graph.\nbinscatter(df['lagdemvoteshare'], df['demvoteshare'], bins=100, alpha=0.5)\\ .set(title='Vote share and incumbency status', xlabel='Dem Vote Share (t-1)', ylabel='Dem Vote Share (t)'); plt.plot(df['lagdemvoteshare'], model.fittedvalues, color='C1') plt.axvline(x=0.5, ls=\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;, color='C2');  Now that we have established a discontinuity at the cutoff, we need to check the RD assumptions.\nFirst, is there sorting across the cutoff? In this case, are democratic politicians more or less likely to lose close elections than republicans? We can plot the distribution of (lagged) vote shares and inspect its shape at the cutoff.\nsns.histplot(df['lagdemvoteshare'], bins=100)\\ .set(title='Distribution of lagged dem vote share', xlabel='') plt.axvline(x=0.5, ls=\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;, color='C2');  If looks pretty smooth. If anything, there is a loss of density at the cutoff, plausibly indicating stronger competition when the competition is close. However, if does not seem particularly asymmetric.\nA placebo test that we can run is to check if the forcing variable has an effect on variables on which we do not expect to have an effect. In this setting, the most intuitive placebo outcome is previous elections: we do not expect that being on either side of the cutoff today is related to any past outcome.\nIn our case, we can simply swap the two variables to run the test.\nbinscatter(df['demvoteshare'], df['lagdemvoteshare'], bins=100)\\ .set(title='Vote share and incumbency status', xlabel='Dem Vote Share (t)', ylabel='Dem Vote Share (t-1)'); plt.axvline(x=0.5, ls=\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;, color='C2');  The distribution of vote shares in the past period does not seem to be discontinuous in the incumbency status today, as expected.\nReferences  Regression discontinuity video lecture by Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham (Yale)  ","date":1649980800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649980800,"objectID":"f64bf2b2655c6c47ee0de6f4b449652a","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/post/regression_discontinuity/","publishdate":"2022-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/regression_discontinuity/","section":"post","summary":"In this tutorial, we are going to see how to estimate causal effects when treatment assignment is not random, but determined by a forcing variable such as a test or a requirement.","tags":null,"title":"Regression Discontinuity","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this page, I collect lectures and materials for graduate courses in Economics and Social Sciences.\nI will only link to lectures and materials that are freely available.

I will first analyze SSH and then look at two specific applications: coding in Python and Julia.\nSetup In order to start working on a remote server you need\n the server local shell SSH installed  SSH, or Secure Shell, is a protocol designed to transfer data between a client and a server (two computers basically) over an untrusted network.\nThe way SSH works is it encrypts the connection using a pair of keys and the server, which is the computer you would connect to, is usually waiting for an SSH connection on Port 22.\nSSH is normally installed by default. To check if you have SSH installed, open the terminal and write ssh. You should receive a message that looks like this\nusage: ssh [-1246AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file] [-J [user@]host[:port]] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port] [-Q query_option] [-R address] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] [user@]hostname [command]  If SSH is not installed, you can install it using the following commands.\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server sudo systemctl enable ssh sudo systemctl start ssh  Now that you have installed SSH, we are ready to setup a remote connection.\nFrom the computer you want to access remotey, generate the public key.\nssh-keygen -t rsa  You will be asked for a location. If you decide to enter one manually then that will be the pair’s location, if you leave the default one it will be inside the .ssh hidden folder in your home directory.\nNow you will be prompted for a password. If you enter one you will be asked for it every time you use the key, this works for added security. If you don’t want a password just press enter and continue without one.\nTwo files were created. One file ends with the ‘.pub’ extension and the other one doesn’t. The file that ends with ‘.pub’ is your public key. This key needs to be in the computer you want to connect to (the server) inside a file called authorized_keys . You can accomplish this with the following command:\nssh-copy-id username@ip  For example in my case to send the key to my computer it would be:\nssh-copy-id sergiop@132.132.132.132  If you have MacOS there’s a chance you don’t have ssh-copy-id installed, in that case you can install it using\nbrew install ssh-copy-id  If you haven’t installed brew, you can install it by following this guide.\nConnect To permanently add the SSH key, you can use the follwing command\nssh-add directory\\key.pem  Lastly, to connect, just type the following command.\nssh username@ip  Where username is the server name and ip is the public IP adress, e.g. 132.132.132.132.\nIf your server is not public, you will not be able to access it.\nIf your server is password protected, you will be prompted to insert a password when you connect. If not, you should protect it with a password.\nManaging screens While you are connected to the remote terminal, any disturbance to your connection will interrupt the code. In order to avoid that, you want to create separate screens. This will allow your code to run remotely undisturbed, irrespectively of your connection.\nFirst, you need to install screen.\nbrew install screen  To create a new screen, just type\nscreen  Now you can lunch your code.\nAfter that, you want to detach from that screen so that the code can run remotely undisturbed.\nscreen -d  Another option is to use ctrl+a followed by ctrl+d. This will detach the screen without the need to type anythin in the terminal, in case the terminal is busy (most likely).\nTo list the current active screens type\nscreen -ls  If you want to check at any time that your code is running, without re-attaching to the screen, you can just type\ntop  which is the general command to check active processes. To exit, use ctrl+z, which generally terminates processes in the terminal.\nTo reattach to your screen, type\nscreen -r  In case you have multiple screens (you can check with screen -ls), you can reattach to a specific one by typing\nscreen -r 12345  where 12345 is the id of the screen.\nTo kill a screen, type\nscreen -XS 12345 quit  where again 12345 is the id of the screen.\nPython and Pycharm If you are coding in Python, PyCharm is one of the best IDEs. Among many features, it offers the possibility to set a remote compiler for your pthon console and to sync input and output files automatically.\nFirst, you need to have setup a remote SSH connection following the steps above. Importantly, you need to have added the public key to your machine using the ssh-add command, as explained above.\nThen open Pytharm, go to the lower-right corner, where the current interpreter is listed (e.g. Pytohn 3.8), click it and select interpreter settings.\nClick on the gear icon ⚙️ on the top-right corner and select add.\nInsert the server host (IP address, e.g. 132.132.132.132) and username (e.g. sergiop).\nNext, you have to insert your credentials. If you have a password, insert it, otherwise you have to insert the path to your SSH key file.\nLastly, select the remote interpreter. If you are using a python version that is not default, browse to the preferred python installation folder. Also, check the box for execute code giving this interpreter with root privileges via sudo.\nYou can also select which remote folder to sync with your local project. By default, you are given a tmp/pycharm_project_XX folder. You can change it if you want. I recommend also to have the last option checked: automatically sync project files to the server. This will automatically synch all remote changes with your local machine, in your local project folder.\nJulia and Juno If you are coding in Julia, Juno is the best IDE around. It’s an integration with Atom with a dedicated compiler, local variables, syntax highlight, autocompletion.\nOn Atom, you first need to install the ftp-remote-edit package.\nThen go to the menu item Packages \u0026gt; Ftp-Remote-Edit \u0026gt; Toggle.\nA new Remote panel will open with the default button to Edit a new server.\nClick it and you will be able to set up your remote connection.\n Press New Insert your username in The name of the server, for example sergiop Insert your ip adress in The hostname or IP adress of the server, for example 123.123.123.123 Select SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol under Protocol Select your Logon option. You can either insert your password every time, just once, or use a keyfile. Insert again your username in Username for autentication, again for example sergiop If you don’t want to start from the root folder, you can change the Initial Directory  Now you will be able to see your remote directory (named for example sergiop) in the Remote panel.\nTo start using Julia remotely, just start a new remote Julia process from the menu on the left.\nNow you are ready to deploy your Julia code on your remote server!\nJupyter Notebooks If you want to have a Jupyter Notebook running remotely, the steps are the following. The main advantage of a Jupyter Notebook is that it allows you to mix text and code in a single file, similarly to RMarkdown, with the advantage of not being contrained to use a R (or Python) kernel. For example, I often use Jupyter Notebook with Julia or Matlab Kernels. Moreover, you can also make nice slides out of it!\nFirst, connect to the remote machine.

In particular, I investigate a platform that has the ability to give prominence to certain products and automates this decision through a reinforcement learning algorithm, that maximizes the platform\u0026rsquo;s profits. Depending on whether the business model of the platform is more aligned with consumer welfare or with sellers' profits (e.g., if it collects quantity or profit fees), the platform either prevents or facilitates collusion among algorithmic sellers. If the platform is also active as a seller, the so-called dual role, it is able to both induce sellers to set high prices and appropriate most of the profits. Importantly, self-preferencing only happens during the learning phase and not in equilibrium. I investigate a potential solution: separating the sales and marketplace divisions.

In particular, the presence of scale economies in one market might propagate to the complementary market, ultimately leading to the monopolization of both. In this paper, we investigate the interplay between two foreclosure practices: exclusionary bundling and predatory pricing in the setting of complementary markets with economies of scale. We show that the two practices are complementary when markets display economies of scale, exclusionary bundling is more likely and, when bundling is allowed, predatory pricing is more likely. We show that this outcome is due to exit-inducing behavior of dominant firms: shutting down predatory incentives restores competition in both markets. We investigate different policies: banning mergers between market leaders, allowing product bundling only when more than one firm is integrated and able to offer the bundle, and lastly knowledge sharing across firms in order to limit the economies of scale.

Recent studies on algorithmic pricing have shown that algorithms can learn sophisticated grim-trigger strategies with the intent of keeping supra-competitive prices. This paper focuses on algorithmic collusion detection. One frequent suggestion is to look at the inputs of the strategies, for example at whether the algorithms condition their prices on previous competitors' prices. The first part of the paper shows that this approach might not be sufficient to detect collusion since the algorithms can learn reward-punishment schemes that are fully independent of the rival’s actions. The mechanism that ensures the stability of supra-competitive prices is self-punishment.\nThe second part of the paper explores a novel test for algorithmic collusion detection. The test builds on the intuition that as algorithms are able to learn to collude, they might be able to learn to exploit collusive strategies. In fact, since they are not designed to learn sub-game perfect equilibrium strategies, there is the possibility that their strategies could be exploited. When one algorithm is unilaterally retrained, keeping the collusive strategies of its competitor fixed, it learns more profitable strategies. Usually, these strategies are more competitive, but not always. Since this change in strategies happens only when algorithms are colluding, retraining can be used as a test to detect algorithmic collusion.\nTo make the test implementable, the last part of the paper studies whether one could get the same insights on collusive behavior using only observational data, from a single algorithm. The result is a unilateral empirical test for algorithmic collusion that does not require any assumptions neither on the algorithms themselves nor on the underlying environment. The key insight is that algorithms, during their learning phase, produce natural experiments that allow an observer to estimate their behavior in counterfactual scenarios. The simulations show that, at least in a controlled experimental setting, the test is extremely successful in detecting algorithmic collusion.\n","date":1631404800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631404800,"objectID":"a444b4a0948fc8347013080cc97eb487","permalink":"https://matteocourthoud.github.io/project/alg_detection/","publishdate":"2021-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/alg_detection/","section":"project","summary":"I show that algorithms can learn reward-punishment schemes that are fully independent from the rival’s actions and I propose a model-free test for algorithmic collusion based on historical data.","tags":["Industrial Organization","Antitrust","Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"Algorithmic Collusion Detection","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this page, I collect useful resources for coding for researchers in social sciences.
